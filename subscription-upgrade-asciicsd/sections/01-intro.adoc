= Introduction

Currently clients subscribe to calendar feeds as an ics file which is
often published as a resource accessible using the unofficial
'webcal' scheme.

The only available option for updating that resource is the usual
HTTP polling of cached resources using Etags.

There is the usual tension between clients wishing to see a timely
response to changes and servers not wishing to be overloaded by
frequent requests for possibly large amounts of data.

This specification introduces an approach whereby clients can
discover a more performant access method.  Given the location of the
resource as an ics file, the client can perform an OPTIONS request on
the resource and inspect the returned headers which will offer a
number of alternative access methods.

Given that many clients already support CalDAV this provides an easy
upgrade path for those clients.  CalDAV and DAV subsets are specified
here to allow lighter weight implementations.
