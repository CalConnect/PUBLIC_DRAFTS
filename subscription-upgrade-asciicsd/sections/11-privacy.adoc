= Privacy Considerations

Properties with a "URI" value type can expose their users to privacy
leaks as any network access of the URI data can be tracked.  Clients
*SHOULD NOT* automatically download data referenced by the URI without
explicit instruction from users.  This specification does not
introduce any additional privacy concerns beyond those described in
<<RFC5545>>.
