== Abstract
This document specifies a protocol that uses calendar objects
to provide scheduling interoperability between
different calendaring systems.  This is done without reference to a
specific transport protocol so as to allow multiple methods of
communication between systems.  Other documents define
profiles of this protocol that use specific, interoperable methods of
communication between systems.

The iCalendar Transport-Independent Interoperability Protocol (iTIP)
complements the calendar object specifications by adding semantics
for group scheduling methods commonly available in current
calendaring systems.  These scheduling methods permit two or more
calendaring systems to perform transactions such as publishing,
scheduling, rescheduling, responding to scheduling requests,
negotiating changes, or canceling.
