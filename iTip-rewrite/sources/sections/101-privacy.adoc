== Privacy Considerations

Properties with a "URI" value type can expose their users to privacy
leaks as any network access of the URI data can be tracked. Clients
SHOULD NOT automatically download data referenced by the URI without
explicit instruction from users. This specification does not
introduce any additional privacy concerns beyond those described in
<<RFC5545>>.
