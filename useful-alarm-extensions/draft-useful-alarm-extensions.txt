1.  Introduction

   The iCalendar [RFC5545] specification defines a set of components
   used to describe calendar data.  One of those is the "VALARM"
   component which appears as a sub-component of "VEVENT" and "VTODO"
   components.  The "VALARM" component is used to specify a reminder for
   an event or task.  Different alarm actions are possible, as are
   different ways to specify how the alarm is triggered.

   This specification defines a set of extensions to "VALARM" components
   to cover requirements for alarms not currently addressed in
   iCalendar.  Each extension is defined in a separate section below.
   For the most part, each extension can be supported independently of
   the others, though in some cases one extension will require another.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   When XML element types in the namespaces "DAV:" and
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:caldav" are referenced in this document
   outside of the context of an XML fragment, the string "DAV:" and
   "CALDAV:" will be prefixed to the element type names respectively.

3.  Extensible syntax for VALARM

   Section 3.6.6 of [RFC5545] defines the syntax for "VALARM" components
   and properties within them.  However, as written, it is hard to
   extend this by adding, e.g., a new property common to all types of
   alarm.  This specification builds on draft-daboo-valarm-extensions
   which defines an extensible form for the VALARM speification.

4.  Alarm Action Types

   This adds some new action types to the specification

4.1.  Alarm Butler Action

   This action is appropriate for those users who would prefer not to be
   required to operate calendar applications themselves but have their
   manservant handle that for them.

   The specification does not attempt to define exactly how the butler
   would notify the user as this is highly client specific, for example,
   a card on a silver tray is often the most appropriate mechanism, for
   others a pot of tea and a quiet reminder is better.

   actionvalue /= "BUTLER"
                  ; Adds a new action for a "VALARM"

   actionprop  /= butlerprop
                  ; Re-defines the "VALARM" component to include
                  ; "butlerprop" as a new set of action properties

   butlerprop   = *(

                  ; no properties are required. It is assumed
                  ; ones manservnt knows best how to awaken the sleeping
                  ; master.

                  ; 'duration' and 'repeat' are both OPTIONAL,
                  ; and MUST NOT occur more than once each,
                  ; but if one occurs, so MUST the other

                  duration / repeat

                  )

4.2.  Alarm Town Crier Action

   This action is appropriate for those situations where the alarm is
   intended for large numbers of users who may not pay sufficient
   attention to their clients and require the services of some public
   agent to ensure they are aware of the alarm.

actionvalue /= "TOWN-CRIER"
               ; Adds a new action for a "VALARM"

actionprop  /= towncrierprop
               ; Re-defines the "VALARM" component to include
               ; "towncrierprop" as a new set of action properties

towncrierprop  = *(

               ; no properties are required. However, the
               ; PRIORITY property in the event may indicate whether simple
               ; shouting will be sufficient. More urgent alarms may
               ; indicate that the use of a handbell is appropriate.
               ;
               ; To standardize the response it is suggested that the
               ; following levels be used for PRIORITY
               ; 1-20 - shouting
               ; 21-40 - handbell
               ; 41-60 - hunting horns
               ; 61-80 - church bells and all of the above
               ; 81 upwards - abject panic is probably already the
               ;      situation so whatever seems appropriate, e.g.
               ;      screaming.

               ; 'duration' and 'repeat' are both OPTIONAL,
               ; and MUST NOT occur more than once each,
               ; but if one occurs, so MUST the other
               ;
               ; For less urgent alarms these guide the crier on their
               ; rounds.

               duration / repeat

               )

4.3.  Carrier Pigeon Action

   This action is appropriate for those users who may be separated from
   their client application.  In this case pigeon post may be an
   appropriate medium to notify the user that some action is(was)
   necessary.

   The acknowledgement feature defined in ? may be used if the recipient
   of the alarm has their own set of pigeons for use when replying.  In
   this case the alarm UID MUST be used to differentiate one pigeons
   message from another

actionvalue /= "PIGEON"
               ; Adds a new action for a "VALARM"

actionprop  /= pigeonprop
               ; Re-defines the "VALARM" component to include
               ; "pigeonprop" as a new set of action properties

pigeonprop   = *(

               ; no properties are required. It is assumed
               ; pigeons will in general be unable to do much more
               ; than return to their loft with an attached alarm.

               ; 'duration' and 'repeat' are both OPTIONAL,
               ; and MUST NOT occur more than once each,
               ; but if one occurs, so MUST the other

               ; For the service this indicates how many pigeons they
               ; SHOULD use in trying to get the message across. In
               ; the case of insufficient pigeons, or the sender simply
               ; feeling the recipient isn't worth the expense there is
               ; no requirement that any more pigeons be used on what is
               ; clearly a pointless excercise.

               duration / repeat

               )

4.4.  Owl Post Action

   This action may be used to indicate that the owl postal service
   should be used where available.

5.  New Properties

5.1.  Owl-Cost

   Property name:  OWL-COST

   Purpose:  This property is used in a VALARM components to specify the
      cost of sending the message.

   Value type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard parameters can be specified on
      this property.

   Conformance:  This property MAY be specified in a VALARM component.

   Description:  In a METHOD:REQUEST each alarm component MAY have a
      OWL-COST property.  This cost SHOULD be paid by the sender .

   Format Definition:

   This property is defined by the following notation:

       owlcost = "OWL-COST" owlcostparams ":"
                     ctext CRLF

       owlcostarams = *(
                     (";" other-param)
                     )


5.2.  Recipient Owl Cost

   Property name:  RECIPIENT-OWL-COST

   Purpose:  This property is used in a VALARM components to specify the
      cost of receiving the message.

   Value type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard parameters can be specified on
      this property.

   Conformance:  This property MAY be specified in a VALARM component.

   Description:  In a METHOD:REQUEST each alarm component MAY have a
      RECIPIENT-OWL-COST property.  This cost SHOULD be paid by the
      receiver.

Internet-Draft              VALARM Extensions               October 2017


   Format Definition:

   This property is defined by the following notation:

       rowlcost   = "RECIPIENT-OWL-COST" rowlcostparams ":"
                     ctext CRLF

       rowlcostarams = *(
                     (";" other-param)
                     )


6.  Example

   The following example shows a "VALARM" component with an owl action
   for a moderately expensive owl.

   BEGIN:VALARM
   UID:77D80D14-906B-4257-963F-85B1E734DBB6
   TRIGGER;VALUE=DATE-TIME:19760401T005545Z
   ACTION:OWL
   DESCRIPTION:Catch the Hogwarts express home
   TRIGGER;VALUE=DATE-TIME:19760401T005545Z
   OWL-COST:1 vole; 1 shrew
   END:VALARM

7.  Security Considerations

   VALARMs, if not monitored properly, can be used to "spam" users and/
   or leak personal information.  For instance, an unwanted owl could be
   considered spam.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  Property Registrations

   This document defines the following new iCalendar properties to be
   added to the registry defined in Section 8.2.3 of [RFC5545]:

          +--------------------+---------+----------------------+
          | Property           | Status  | Reference            |
