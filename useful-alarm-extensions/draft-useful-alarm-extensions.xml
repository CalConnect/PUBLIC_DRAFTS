      <t>This document defines a set of extensions to the iCalendar
        VALARM component which seem to be missing for certain classes
        of calendar user.</t>

    <section title='Introduction'>
      <t>The <xref target="RFC5545">iCalendar</xref> specification
        defines a set of components used to describe calendar data. One
        of those is the "VALARM" component which appears as a
        sub-component of "VEVENT" and "VTODO" components. The "VALARM"
        component is used to specify a reminder for an event or
        task. Different alarm actions are possible, as are different
        ways to specify how the alarm is triggered.
      </t>

      <t>This specification defines a set of extensions to "VALARM"
        components to cover requirements for alarms not currently
        addressed in iCalendar. Each extension is defined in a separate
        section below. For the most part, each extension can be
        supported independently of the others, though in some cases one
        extension will require another. </t>
    </section>

    <section title='Conventions Used in This Document'>
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
        NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
        "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
        described in <xref target='RFC2119' />.</t>

      <t>When XML element types in the namespaces "DAV:" and
        "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:caldav" are referenced in this document
        outside of the context of an XML fragment, the string "DAV:" and
        "CALDAV:" will be prefixed to the element type names
        respectively.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Extensible syntax for VALARM" anchor="syntax">
      <t>Section 3.6.6 of <xref target="RFC5545" /> defines the syntax
        for "VALARM" components and properties within them. However, as
        written, it is hard to extend this by adding, e.g., a new
        property common to all types of alarm. This specification builds
        on draft-daboo-valarm-extensions which defines an extensible
        form for the VALARM speification.</t>

    <section title="Alarm Action Types" anchor='action_types'>
      <t>This adds some new action types to the specification</t>
      
      <section title="Alarm Butler Action" anchor='butler_action'>
        <t>This action is appropriate for those users who would prefer
          not to be required to operate calendar applications themselves
          but have their manservant handle that for them.
        </t>
        <t>
          The specification does not attempt to define exactly how the
          butler would notify the user as this is highly client specific,
          for example, a card on a silver tray is often the most
          appropriate mechanism, for others a pot of tea and a quiet
          reminder is better.
