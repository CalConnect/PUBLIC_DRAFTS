= Link relation subscribe-caldav-auth

This specifies an access point which is a full implementation of
caldav and requires authentication.  This may allow read-write access
to the resource.

The client *MUST* follow the specification to determine exactly what
operations are allowed on the access point - for example to determine
if sync-report is supported.
