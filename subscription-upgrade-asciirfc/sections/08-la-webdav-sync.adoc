= Link relation subscribe-webdav-sync

This specifies an access point which supports only webdav sync.

This allows the client to issue a sync-report on the resource to
obtain updates.

NOTE: say something about initial startup - use ics to populate?
Initial token?

The client *MUST* follow that specification.
