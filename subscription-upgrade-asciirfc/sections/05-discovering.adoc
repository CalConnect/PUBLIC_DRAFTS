== Discovering alternative access methods

The advertising of other access points is achieved through the use of
the LINK header as defined in <<RFC5988>>.  New link relation types are
defined in this specification - each being associated with a protocol
or protocol subset.

These LINK headers will be delivered when a client carries out an
OPTIONS request targeting the URL of the resource.
