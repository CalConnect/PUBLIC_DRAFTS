= Link relation subscribe-caldav

This specifies an access point which is a full implementation of
caldav but requires no authentication.  The end point allows the full
range of reports as defined by the CalDAV specification.

The client *MUST* follow the specification to determine exactly what
operations are allowed on the access point - for example to determine
if sync-report is supported.

The URL *MAY* include some form of token to allow write access to the
targeted collection.  The client must check it's permissions to
determine whether or not it has been granted write access.
