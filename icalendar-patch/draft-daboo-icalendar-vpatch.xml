    <section title='Introduction'>
      <t>The <xref target='RFC5545'>iCalendar</xref> data format is in
      widespread use to represent calendar data. iCalendar data can
      grow large (e.g., a family calendar containing events over a
      period of several years). Updating large resources over the
      network currently requires the entire data to be sent - even if
      the change itself is minor.</t>

      <t>This specification defines a new iCalendar component that can
      be used to "patch" (incrementally update) iCalendar data in an
      efficient manner. When combined with the HTTP <xref
      target="RFC5789">PATCH method</xref>, it can be used to update
      calendar object resources on a <xref
      target="RFC4791">CalDAV</xref> server, or any resource on an
      HTTP server that contains iCalendar data.</t>

    <section title="Overview" anchor="vpatch-component">
      <t> The basic design of the patch format is a "VPATCH" component (defined in <xref target="vpatch"/>) containing one or more "PATCH" components (defined in <xref target="patch"/>), each specifying a path (which identifies one or more components in the iCalendar object being patched), and other components and properties that define the set of changes to be made.</t>
      <t>When multiple "VPATCH" components are present in an iCalendar object, the order in which they are applied is defined by the value of any "PATCH-ORDER" properties in the "VPATCH" components. The "VPATCH" components are sorted in order from lowest "PATCH-ORDER" integer value to highest, with any components not containing a "PATCH-ORDER" property placed last. The patch process is then applied in sorted order (any components with the same "PATCH-ORDER" value can be applied in any order).</t>
      <t>No specific processing order is defined for multiple "PATCH" components in a "VPATCH" component.</t>
      <t>The "VPATCH" component also contains an optional "PATCH-VERSION" property to allow future extensions to the format to be recognized. This document only defines version number "1". The "PATCH-VERSION" property only needs to be present if the version number is greater than "1".  If a patch processing engine is unable to handle the indicated version it MUST reject the entire patch operation defined by the enclosing iCalendar object, even if other "VPATCH" components have a "PATCH-VERSION" number that is supported.</t>
      <t>After applying a patch to an iCalendar object, the basic validity of the resulting iCalendar object SHOULD be checked by the processing engine (e.g., if the patch added an extra "DTSTART" property to a "VEVENT" component that would be considered a violation of <xref target="RFC5545"/>'s cardinality rules for the "DTSTART" property in a "VEVENT"). If this occurs, the patch operation MUST fail.</t>
      <t>Other validity constraints can be applied if needed. For example, <xref target="RFC4791">CalDAV</xref> requires that the "UID" property be the same in all components in a calendar object resource stored on the server. If a patch operation adds a component to an iCalendar object with a different "UID" value than the existing components, that result would be an invalid CalDAV calendar object resource. If other validity constraints are violated, the patch operation MUST fail.</t>
      <t>Any failure to process a "VPATCH" component, for whatever reason, MUST result in the entire patch operation being cancelled, with the iCalendar object being patched left in its original state.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="PATCH Component" anchor="patch-component">
      <t>A "PATCH" component (defined in <xref target="patch"/>) MUST contain one "PATCH-TARGET" property whose value is an iCalendar path (see <xref target="path"/>) that identifies components within the iCalendar object being patched (see <xref target="recurrences"/> for special handling of components representing recurring items). The set of components thus identified are the "target components" for the patch operations. The set of patch operations defined by the other components and properties present in the "PATCH" component are then applied to each target component (in the order specified below). If a "PATCH-TARGET" property does not match any components in the iCalendar object being patched, then the patch operation MUST succeed without any changes being applied to the iCalendar object being patched.</t>
      <t>Four patch operations are supported:
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>Component additions or updates: any components within the "PATCH" component are considered to be additions or updates (see <xref target="patch-components"/>).</t>
          <t>Property additions or updates: any properties (other than those whose name starts with the "PATCH-" prefix) are considered to be additions or updates (see <xref target="patch-properties"/>).</t>
          <t>Component, property, property parameter, property value, or property parameter value deletion: indicated by the present of one or more "PATCH-DELETE" properties (see <xref target="patch-delete"/>).</t>
          <t>Property parameter additions or updates: indicated by the presence of one or more "PATCH-PARAMETER" properties (see <xref target="patch-parameters"/>).</t>
        </list>
        When processing a "PATCH" component, the processing engine MUST follow this order:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Process all "PATCH-DELETE" properties first.</t>
          <t>Process all "PATCH-PARAMETER" properties second.</t>
          <t>Process all other components third.</t>
          <t>Process all non "PATCH-" prefixed properties fourth.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="iCalendar Path" anchor="path">
      <t>The "PATCH-TARGET", "PATCH-DELETE", and "PATCH-PARAMETER" property values are all iCalendar "paths". The path is used to match iCalendar elements that the patch operation will be applied to.  The path is a list of "segments" (separated by the "/", "#", ";" or "=" characters) that matches an iCalendar element in the iCalendar object model hierarchy (a component, a property, a property parameter, a property value, or a property parameter value). A path can either be "absolute" (referring to items within the top-level iCalendar object being patched) or "relative" (referring to items within some other component as determined by the scope of the operation).</t>
      
      <t>A path can start with a series of component segments (which always have a "/" prefix). Those can be followed by a property segment (which always has a "#" prefix"). A property segment can be followed by either a parameter segment (which always has a ";" prefix), or a value segment (which always has a "=" prefix). A parameter segment can be followed by a value segment (which always has a "=" prefix).</t>

      <t>An absolute path always starts with a "/VCALENDAR" component segment since an iCalendar object is always a single "VCALENDAR" component.</t>

      <t>A relative path can start with a component segment or a property segment, with the path assumed to be relative to an enclosing component defined by the context.</t>

      <t>To target a component inside of another component, a component segment is appended to the path. Component segments can include an optional match item.  When present, this allows targeting of components that match a specific "UID" property value, and/or a "RECURRENCE-ID" value (or lack of "RECURRENCE-ID" property to target a "master" recurrence component). See <xref target="recurrences"/> for special handling of components representing recurring items.</t>

      <t>To target a property inside of a component, a property segment is added to the path. A property segment can include an optional match item. When present, this allows targeting of properties by value (matching or not matching a specific value), or which have a named property parameter present, or by property parameter value (matching or not matching a specific value).</t>

      <t>To target a property parameter, a parameter segment is added to the property segment at the end of the path.</t>

      <t>To target a single value in a multi-valued property, a value segment is added to the property segment at the end of the path.</t>

      <t>To target a single value in a multi-valued property parameter, a value segment is added to the parameter segment at the end of the path.</t>
      
      <t>Values in match items MUST use URL-style percent (%) encoding of the characters "/", "#", ";", "=", and "]".  This allows a path to be quickly split into segments by breaking apart the text on the relevant delimiter characters.</t>

      <t> 
        The syntax for a path is defined by the following notation (note that some of the syntax elements defined here are not used by this specification, however, it is anticipated that this general path syntax will be useful for other specifications):

    <section title="Adding or Updating Components" anchor="patch-components">
      <t>Any iCalendar component defined in the "PATCH" component (referred to below as the "action component") is treated as either an addition to the target component, or as an update of an existing component in the target component. The following rules are used to process such components:

        <t>If the action component contains a "UID" property and a "RECURRENCE-ID" property, then any components with the same values for both their "UID" and "RECURRENCE-ID" properties, that are immediate sub-components of the target component, are removed from the target component, and the action component is added to the target component.</t>
        <t>If the action component contains a "UID" property and does not contain a "RECURRENCE-ID" property, then any components with the same value for their "UID" property, and containing no "RECURRENCE-ID" property, that are immediate sub-components of the target component, are removed from the target component, and the action component is added to the target component.</t>

    <section title="Adding or Updating Properties" anchor="patch-properties">
      <t>Any iCalendar property defined in the "PATCH" component (referred to below as the "action property") is treated as either an addition to the target component, or as an update of an existing property in the target component. A <xref target="patchaction">"PATCH-ACTION"</xref> property parameter can be defined on action properties and is used to control how the action is processed. Any "PATCH-ACTION" property parameter MUST be removed from the action property when it is added to the target component. The following rules are used to process such properties:
      <list style="numbers">
        <t>If the action property does not contain a "PATCH-ACTION" property parameter, or contains a "PATCH-ACTION" property parameter with the default value "BYNAME", then all properties with the same name in the target component are removed, and the action property is added to the target component.</t>
        <t>If the action property contains a "PATCH-ACTION" property parameter with the value "CREATE", then the action property is added to the target component.</t>
        <t>If the action property contains a "PATCH-ACTION" property parameter with the value "BYVALUE", then all properties with the same name and same value in the target component are removed, and the action property is added to the target component.</t>
        <t>If the action property contains a "PATCH-ACTION" property parameter with the value starting with "BYPARAM", then all properties with the same name and a property parameter that matches the one that is part of the "PATCH-ACTION" property value, in the target component are removed, and the action property is added to the target component.</t>
      </list>
      </t>
      <t>The "PATCH-ACTION=BYNAME" operation is used for adding or updating "singleton" properties - properties that only appear once in a given iCalendar component (e.g., "DTSTART", "DTEND", "LOCATION", etc).</t>
      <t>The "PATCH-ACTION=CREATE" operation is used for adding "multi-occurring" properties - properties that can appear more than once in a given iCalendar component (e.g., "ATTENDEE", "ATTACH", "EXDATE", etc).</t>
      <t>The "PATCH-ACTION=BYVALUE" operation is used for updating a specific "multi-occurring" property that can be uniquely identified by its value (e.g., the "ATTENDEE" property can appear multiple times in a "VEVENT" component, but each property will have a unique value in that component). This operation cannot be used when the value of the property is being changed. Instead, the "PATCH-ACTION=BYPARAM" operation can be used to identify the target property.</t>
      <t>The "PATCH-ACTION=BYPARAM" operation is used for updating a specific "multi-occurring" property that can be uniquely identified by a parameter value that is the same in the action and target properties.</t>
      <t>There may be some situations where a multi-occurring property cannot be uniquely identified. In such cases, the solution to updating one or more of them is to use a "PATCH-ACTION=BYNAME" to replace all the existing properties with one new one, then use "PATCH-ACTION=CREATE" to add back others that are unchanged or also being updated. Whilst this is not ideal, it is anticipated that these situations can be avoided by adding appropriate property parameters with unique values to help disambiguate the multi-occurring properties.</t>

    <section title="Additional Considerations">
      <section title="Handling Default Properties and Parameters"
               anchor="defaults">
        <t>iCalendar properties and property parameters can have default values, which allows those items to be omitted from the iCalendar data, but with the default value assumed. A patch operation might add properties or property parameters with default values. A patch processing engine MAY choose to remove properties or property parameters with default values from the patched iCalendar object.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Handling Recurrences" anchor="recurrences">
        <t>Recurring events (or other types of component) in iCalendar are defined by the presence of "RRULE", "RDATE", and "EXDATE" properties in a "master" iCalendar component. Those rules produce a set of "generated" instances. In some cases specific "generated" instances are changed, resulting in the presence of "overridden" components, which are identified by having the same "UID" property value as the "master" component, and a "RECURRENCE-ID" property whose value matches the start time of the corresponding "generated" instance (which can be different from the actual start time of the overridden instance).</t>

        <t>When a set of master and overridden recurring components exist in the iCalendar object being patched, each can be uniquely targeted by using the "RID=" match item in the component segment of the path value of a "PATCH-TARGET" or "PATCH-DELETE" property. To target the master component, a "RID=M" match item is used. To target an overridden component, the "RID=" value is set to the value of the "RECURRENCE-ID" property in the overridden component.</t>
        
        <t>Patch commands can also be used to implicitly create overridden components in the iCalendar object being patched by specifying a path with a "RID=" match item, using what would be the overridden component's "RECURRENCE-ID" value if it existed as a separate component. This is useful when an overridden component needs to be added, but the changes to it are small (e.g., an instance where only the summary of the event is different).</t>

        <t>If the value of a "RID=" match item in a path does not correspond to an existing instance (either because its value does not match a "generated" instance, or its value matches an "EXDATE" in the "master" component), then the patch operation MUST fail.</t>

        <t>For example, consider the following daily recurring event:
        <figure><artwork>
BEGIN:VCALENDAR
PRODID:test
VERSION:2.0
BEGIN:VEVENT
UID:1234
DTSTART:20160902T120000Z
DURATION:PT1H
SUMMARY:Master component
RRULE:FREQ=DAILY
END:VEVENT
END:VCALENDAR
</artwork></figure>
        The following patch command could be used to update the
        "SUMMARY" property value of the second instance of the
        recurring event:
        <figure><artwork>
BEGIN:VPATCH
UID:abcd
DTSTAMP:20160901T000000Z
BEGIN:PATCH
PATCH-TARGET:/VCALENDAR/VEVENT[UID=1234][RID=20160903T120000Z]
SUMMARY:Override second instance
END:PATCH
END:VPATCH
</artwork></figure>
        which results in the following updated iCalendar component:
        <figure><artwork>
BEGIN:VCALENDAR
PRODID:test
VERSION:2.0
BEGIN:VEVENT
UID:1234
DTSTART:20160902T120000Z
DURATION:PT1H
SUMMARY:Master component
RRULE:FREQ=DAILY
END:VEVENT
BEGIN:VEVENT
UID:1234
RECURRENCE-ID=20160903T120000Z
DTSTART:20160903T120000Z
DURATION:PT1H
SUMMARY:Override second instance
END:VEVENT
END:VCALENDAR
</artwork></figure>
        A similar result could have been achieved by using a
        path targeting the "VCALENDAR" component, and the entire
        "overridden" component supplied as the data. However, the
        implicit override behaviour allows for a more compact
        representation of this type of change.
        </t>

        <t>There is no equivalent behavior when it comes to removing "overridden" components from an iCalendar object to cancel the instance. In that case, two "PATCH" components are required: one to delete the "overridden" component, and one to create an "EXDATE" property value in the master component to cover the cancellation. So, continuing from the example data immediately above, the following patch commands would cancel the instance that was previously overridden:
        <figure><artwork>
BEGIN:VPATCH
UID:abcd
DTSTAMP:20160901T000000Z
BEGIN:PATCH

EXDATE;PATCH-ACTION=CREATE:20160903T120000Z
END:PATCH
END:VPATCH
</artwork></figure>
        which results in the following updated iCalendar component:
        <figure><artwork>

      <section title="Folded lines" anchor="folding">
        <t>iCalendar data can contain "folded" lines (as described
        in Section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC5545" />). The patch
        operations described in this specification are a
        "semantic" rather than "syntactic" update to the
        data. i.e., they apply to the underlying object model as
        opposed to the "raw" iCalendar text data. As such, folded
        lines in the iCalendar data targeted by the patch commands
        are not significant. Any iCalendar data supplied as data
        items in a patch command MAY contain folded lines.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Encoding" anchor="encoding">
        <t>Text values in iCalendar use a backslash escape
        mechanism for certain characters (as described in Section
        3.3.11 <xref target="RFC5545" />). Patch operations apply
        to the escaped form of the iCalendar data. For example, to
        delete a "DESCRIPTION" property that contains an encoded
        line feed character:
        <figure><artwork>
DESCRIPTION:Line one\nLine two
</artwork></figure>
        the following PATCH-DELETE property would be used:
        <figure><artwork>
PATCH-DELETE:#DESCRIPTION[=Line one\nLine two]
</artwork></figure>
        Similarly, to update the "DESCRIPTION" property, the
        following patch command could be used:
        <figure><artwork>
BEGIN:VPATCH
UID:abcd
DTSTAMP:20160901T000000Z
BEGIN:PATCH
PATCH-TARGET:/VCALENDAR/VEVENT
DESCRIPTION:Line one\nLine two\nLine three
END:PATCH
END:VPATCH

        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Generation" anchor="generation">
        <t>This specification does not define how patch data is generated, as that is likely to be highly dependent on the nature of the implementation. However, it is recommended that patch generators use sets of commands that keep the overall patch data as compact as possible, since one of the goals of this specification is to reduce the size of data needed to do updates. One example is the choice of whether to update an entire property, or just property parameters, when changes are made to just property parameters. In some cases, the data in a property parameter can be large, so repeating that in a full property update may result in larger data than simple using the "PATCH-PARAMETER" property to do an update. On the other hand, if lots of property parameters are being updated or removed, it can be more efficient to update the entire property rather than using lots of "PATCH-PARAMETER" and "PATCH-DELETE" properties.</t>

    <section title='Use with iTIP'>
      <t><xref target="RFC5546">iTIP</xref> defines how iCalendar data
      can be sent between calendar user agents to schedule calendar
      components between calendar users. This specification does not
      define how iCalendar patch documents can be used with iTIP.</t>
    </section>

    <section title='Use with CalDAV and HTTP'>
      <t>The <xref target="RFC4791">CalDAV</xref> calendar access
      protocol allows clients and servers to exchange iCalendar
      data. iCalendar data is typically stored in calendar object
      resources on a CalDAV server. A CalDAV client typically updates
      the calendar object resource data via an HTTP PUT request, which
      requires sending the entire iCalendar object in the HTTP request
      body.</t>

      <t>A server can also support the HTTP <xref
      target="RFC5789">PATCH method</xref> which allows a patch
      document to be specified in the request body, and for that patch
      document to be applied to the resource targeted by the HTTP
      request. In this case, the server would advertise the
      "text/calendar" media type in an "Accept-Patch" header field as
      described in Section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC5789"/>.  Note that
      the requirements for parameters on this media type when
      advertised in "Accept-Patch" are as follows:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>MUST include a "component" parameter with a value of
        "VPATCH"</t>
        <t>MUST include an "optinfo" parameter with a value of
        "PATCH-VERSION:&lt;n&gt;", where &lt;n&gt; is the maximum
        patch version supported by the server</t>
        <t>MAY include a "charset" parameter as appropriate</t>
      </list>For example:
      <figure><artwork>
Accept-Patch: text/calendar; component=VPATCH;
 optinfo="PATCH-VERSION:1"; charset=utf-8
      </artwork></figure>
      </t>

      <t>The PATCH-TARGET property defined by this
      specification does not allow targeting the entire iCalendar
      object, and hence an HTTP PATCH request cannot be used to create
      a new resource (a normal HTTP PUT request is used instead).</t>
    </section>

    <section title='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>
      <t>Patch processing engines MUST ensure that the result of applying a patch is a valid iCalendar object in the context of the application using the calendar data. At the very least, the resulting iCalendar object MUST comply with the requirements of <xref target="RFC5545" />.</t>

      <section title="Attendee updating their participation status">
        <t>When an attendee updates their participation status in an
        event, they will typically: update the "PARTSTAT" parameter on
        their "ATTENDEE" property, remove the "RSVP" parameter on
        their "ATTENDEE" property, update the "TRANSP" property in the
        "VEVENT" component. This set of changes is shown below in a
        single "PATCH" component, with the attendee having the
        calendar user address "mailto:cyrus@example.com". The patch
        targets all "VEVENT" components in the iCalendar object being
        changed.</t>
