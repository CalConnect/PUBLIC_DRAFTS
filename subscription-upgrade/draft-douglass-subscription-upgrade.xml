    <abstract>
      <t>
        This specification introduces an approach to allow subscribers
        to calendar feeds to upgrade to a more performant protocol.
      </t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        Currently clients subscribe to calendar feeds as an ics file 
        which is oftenb published as a resource accessible using the 
        unofficila 'webcal' scheme.
      </t>

      <t>
        The only available option  for updating that resource is the 
        usual http polling of cached resources using etags.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        There is the usual tension between clients wishing to see
        a timely response to changes and servers not wising to be 
        overloaded by frequent requests for possibly large amounts of
        data.
      </t>

      <t>
        This specification introduces an approach whereby clients can 
        discover a more performant access method. Given the location of 
        the resource as an ics file, the client can download the file 
        and inspect the returned headers which will offer a number of 
        alternative access methods.
      </t>

      <t>
        Given that many clients already support CalDAV this provides an
        easy upgrade path for those clients. CalDAV and DAV subsets are 
        specified here to allow lighter weight implementations. 
      </t>
      
      <section anchor="conventions" title='Conventions Used in This Document'>
        <t>
          The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
          NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
          "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
          described in <xref target='RFC2119'/>.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Changes to the iCalendar specifications">
      <t>
        This speciifcation does not require any chnages to 
        <xref target='RFC5545'/>  or its extensions. However it does
        introduce the use of some properties to provide more information 
        about the resource, for example the time range it covers.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Link Header">
      <t>
        The advertizing of other access points is achieved through the 
        use of the LINK header as defined in <xref target='RFC5988'/>. 
        New link relation types are 
        defined in this specification - each being associated with a 
        protocol or protocol subset.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="link_relation_subscribe_caldav"
             title="Link relation subscribe-caldav">
      <t>
        This specifies an access point which is a full implementation of 
        caldav but requires no authentication. The end point is read only
        but allows the full range of reports as defined by the CalDAV
        specification.
      </t>
      <t>
        The client MUST follow the specification to determine exactly 
        what operations are allowed on the access point - for example 
        to determine if sync-report is supported.  
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="link_relation_subscribe_caldav_auth"
             title="Link relation subscribe-caldav-auth">
      <t>
        This specifies an access point which is a full implementation of
        caldav and requires authentication. This may allow read-write
        access to the resource.
      </t>
      <t>
        The client MUST follow the specification to determine exactly
        what operations are allowed on the access point - for example
        to determine if sync-report is supported.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="link_relation_subscribe_webdav_sync"
             title="Link relation subscribe-webdav-sync">
      <t>
        This specifies an access point which supports only webdav sync.
      </t>
      <t>
        This allows the client to issue a sync-report on the resource
        to obtain updates.
      </t>
      <t>
        NOTE: say somethign about initial startup - use ics to populate? 
        Initial token?
      </t>
      <t>
        The client MUST follow that specification.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="link_relation_subscribe_something_else"
             title="Link relation subscribe-something-else">
      <t>
        This specifies an access point which supports something new.
      </t>
      <t>
        The client MUST follow that specification.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title='Security Considerations'>
      <t>
       Applications using these properties need to be aware of the risks
       entailed in using the URIs provided as values. See [RFC3986] for
       a discussion of the security considerations relating to URIs.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title='Privacy Considerations' anchor='privacy'>
      <t>
        Properties with a "URI" value type can expose their users to 
        privacy leaks as any network access of the URI data can be 
        tracked. Clients SHOULD NOT automatically download data 
        referenced by the URI without explicit instruction from users. 
        This specification does not introduce any additional privacy 
        concerns beyond those described in <xref target="RFC5545" />.
      </t>
    </section>

          This document defines the following new iCalendar properties to be

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
