Abstract

   This specification introduces an approach to allow subscribers to
   calendar feeds to upgrade to a more performant protocol.

   This specification updates [RFC5545] to add the value DELETED to the
   STATUS property.

   This specification also updates [RFC7240] to add the subscribe-
   enhanced-get and sync-token preferences.

1.  Introduction

   Currently clients subscribe to calendar feeds as an ics file which is
   often published as a resource accessible using the unofficial
   'webcal' scheme.

   The only available option for updating that resource is the usual
   HTTP polling of cached resources using Etags.

   There is the usual tension between clients wishing to see a timely
   response to changes and servers not wishing to be overloaded by
   frequent requests for possibly large amounts of data.

   This specification introduces an approach whereby clients can
   discover a more performant access method.  Given the location of the
   resource as an ics file, the client can perfom an HEAD request on the
   resource and inspect the returned headers which will offer a number
   of alternative access methods.

   Given that many clients already support CalDAV this provides an easy
   upgrade path for those clients.  CalDAV and DAV subsets are specified
   here to allow lighter weight implementations.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.  Enhanced GET

2.1.  Introduction

   This is a lightweight protocol which allows simple clients to
   efficiently discover and download changes in the targeted resource.

   It has many similarities to WebDAV sync and for a server could be
   implemented as an extension of the specification.

   In this protocol the client MUST include the Prefer header field
   preference "subscribe-enhanced-get".  If a sync token is available it
   is passed as a parameter to that preference.

   The client MAY include the Prefer header field preference
   "handling=strict".  If included and an invalid sync-token is passed
   in the request the server MUST return an error response instead of a
   full set of data.

   The resource is treated as a set of individual events each of which
   may be updated or deleted separately.  The client will first fetch
   the entire ics file.  On subsequent requests it uses the Prefer
   header with a "sync-token" parameter to indicate that it wants a set
   of changes since the last fetch.

2.2.  Deletions

   When an entity (VEVENT, VTODO or other valid top-level component) is
   deleted from the source data the server needs to be able to inform a
   client of the deletion.  This specification introduces a new value
   for the STATUS property of DELETED.

   On the first enhanced GET after the entity has been deleted a
   skeleton, but valid, entity will be returned with STATUS: DELETED.
   The receiving client is free to remove the entity or update it's
   STATUS property.

   On subsequent fetches the entity will not be returned.

2.3.  Handling of invalid sync tokens

   The default behavior is to treat an invalid sync token as if none
   were supplied.  This will result in all data being returned with a
   new valid token.

   For some clients and with some very large sets of data, such behavior
   may be problematic.  To suppress the return of data on an invalid
   token the client should include the Prefer header field preference
   "handling=strict".

   When a server receives an invalid token and the "handling=strict"
   preference is supplied, the server MUST return a 412 status,
   precondition failed.  The server MAY choose to return an error
   message in the body.

   The client SHOULD respond to this error by restarting the interaction
   from scratch, i.e. retrieve the full set of data then poll for
   updates.

2.4.  Paging the response

   A client may explicitly request a limit on the size of the response
   by specifying the Prefer header field preference "limit=n" where n is
   the number of components.

   When a server receives a request specifying such a limit it SHOULD
   limit the response to that number of components.  If the limit causes
   a truncation in the response the server should respond with WHAT? and
   return a sync token which may be used to retrieve the next batch of
   data.

   The truncated status allows the client to immediately resubmit a
   request for the next batch.

Internet-Draft       Calendar subscription upgrades           March 2019


   A server MAY choose to limit the response size.  The behavior SHOULD
   be as if the client had provided a preference for that size -
   allowing the client to retrieve the full set of data in batches.

2.5.  Caching of responses

   To enable proper caching of responses the server SHOULD provide a
   VARY header field in responses that names the Prefer header field
   along with any other that are appropriate.

   Clients should order the preferences in the following manner so that
   identical responses can be identified...

   NOTE: need to discuss this further and check on the HTTP specs to
   ensure this makes sense.

2.6.  Examples

   This is an example of the initial request and response from a server
   that supports the extended GET protocol.

     >> Request <<

     GET /events.ics HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.com
     Accept: text/calendar
     Prefer: subscribe-enhanced-get

     >> Response <<

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Content-Length: xxxx
     ETag: "1234"                    current ETag (for conditional GET)
     Preference-Applied: subscribe-enhanced-get; sync-token="1234567"
     Vary: Prefer, If-None-Match            so caching proxy can key off
     ;                                      client?s ETag and preference

      BEGIN:VCALENDAR:
      ?  /* full feed */
      END:VCALENDAR


   This is an example of the subsequent request and response when no
   changes have occurred.

Internet-Draft       Calendar subscription upgrades           March 2019


      >> Request <<

      GET /events.ics HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com
      Accept: text/calendar
      Prefer: subscribe-enhanced-get; sync-token="1234567"

      >> Response <<

      HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
      Content-Length: 0
      ETag: ?1234?
      Vary: Prefer, If-None-Match
      Preference-Applied: subscribe-enhanced-get; sync-token="1234567"


   This is an example of the subsequent request and response when
   changes have occurred and the server cannot return only changed data
   - perhaps because of an old or invalid token.  Because
   handling=strict was not supplied as a preference all data is returned
   in the response.

      >> Request <<

      GET /events.ics HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com
      Accept: text/calendar
      Prefer: subscribe-enhanced-get; sync-token="1234567"

      >> Response <<

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Content-Type: text/calendar
      Content-Length: xxxx
      Preference-Applied: subscribe-enhanced-get; sync-token="56789"

      BEGIN:VCALENDAR:
      ...  full set of data
      END:VCALENDAR


3.  Changes to the iCalendar specifications

   This specification updates [RFC5545] to add the value DELETED to the
   STATUS property.  It also introduces the use of some properties to
   provide more information about the resource, for example the time
   range it covers.

3.1.  Redefined Status property

   Property name:  STATUS

   Purpose:  This property defines the overall status or confirmation
      for the calendar component.

   Value Type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  IANA and non-standard property parameters can
      be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified once in "VEVENT",
      "VTODO", or "VJOURNAL" calendar components.

   Description:  In a group-scheduled calendar component, the property
      is used by the "Organizer" to provide a confirmation of the event
      to the "Attendees".  For example in a "VEVENT" calendar component,
      the "Organizer" can indicate that a meeting is tentative,
      confirmed, or cancelled.  In a "VTODO" calendar component, the
      "Organizer" can indicate that an action item needs action, is
      completed, is in process or being worked on, or has been
      cancelled.  In a "VJOURNAL" calendar component, the "Organizer"
      can indicate that a journal entry is draft, final, or has been
      cancelled or removed.

   Format Definition:

Internet-Draft       Calendar subscription upgrades           March 2019


   This property is defined by the following notation:

     status          = "STATUS" statparam ":" statvalue CRLF

     statparam       = *(";" other-param)

     statvalue       = (statvalue-event
                     /  statvalue-todo
                     /  statvalue-jour)

     statvalue-event = "TENTATIVE"    ;Indicates event is tentative.
                     / "CONFIRMED"    ;Indicates event is definite.
                     / "CANCELLED"    ;Indicates event was cancelled.
                     / "DELETED"      ;Indicates event was deleted.
     ;Status values for a "VEVENT"

     statvalue-todo  = "NEEDS-ACTION" ;Indicates to-do needs action.
                     / "COMPLETED"    ;Indicates to-do completed.
                     / "IN-PROCESS"   ;Indicates to-do in process of.
                     / "CANCELLED"    ;Indicates to-do was cancelled.
                     / "DELETED"      ;Indicates to-do was deleted.
     ;Status values for "VTODO".

     statvalue-jour  = "DRAFT"        ;Indicates journal is draft.
                     / "FINAL"        ;Indicates journal is final.
                     / "CANCELLED"    ;Indicates journal is removed.
                     / "DELETED"      ;Indicates journal was deleted.
     ;Status values for "VJOURNAL".

   Example:

   Example: The following is an example of this property for a "VEVENT"
   calendar component:

     STATUS:TENTATIVE

   The following is an example of this property for a "VTODO" calendar
   component:

     STATUS:NEEDS-ACTION

   The following is an example of this property for a "VJOURNAL"
   calendar component:

     STATUS:DRAFT

4.  New Prefer header field preferences

4.1.  Preference subscribe-enhanced-get

   This indicates that the client expects the server to handle the GET
   method according to the specifications for enhanced get.

     pref-subscribe-enhanced-get = "subscribe-enhanced-get"

   This preference MAY be followed by a synch-token preference.

4.2.  Preference sync-token_parameter

   This preference parameter provides a sync token for enhanced get.

     pref-sync-token = "sync-token" BWS "=" BWS DQUOTE value DQUOTE

5.  Discovering alternative access methods

   The advertising of other access points is achieved through the use of
   the LINK header as defined in [RFC5988].  New link relation types are
   defined in this specification - each being associated with a protocol
   or protocol subset.

   These LINK headers will be delivered when a client carries out a HEAD
   request targeting the URL of the resource.

6.  Link relation subscribe-caldav

   This specifies an access point which is a full implementation of
   caldav but requires no authentication.  The end point allows the full
   range of reports as defined by the CalDAV specification.

   The client MUST follow the specification to determine exactly what
   operations are allowed on the access point - for example to determine
   if sync-report is supported.

   The URL MAY include some form of token to allow write access to the
   targeted collection.  The client must check it's permissions to
   determine whether or not it has been granted write access.

7.  Link relation subscribe-caldav-auth

   This specifies an access point which is a full implementation of
   caldav and requires authentication.  This may allow read-write access
   to the resource.

   The client MUST follow the specification to determine exactly what
   operations are allowed on the access point - for example to determine
   if sync-report is supported.

8.  Link relation subscribe-webdav-sync

   This specifies an access point which supports only webdav sync.

   This allows the client to issue a sync-report on the resource to
   obtain updates.

   NOTE: say something about initial startup - use ics to populate?
   Initial token?

   The client MUST follow that specification.

9.  Link relation subscribe-enhanced-get

   This specifies an access point which supports something new.

   The client MUST follow that specification.

10.  Security Considerations

   Applications using these properties need to be aware of the risks
   entailed in using the URIs provided as values.  See [RFC3986] for a
   discussion of the security considerations relating to URIs.

11.  Privacy Considerations

   Properties with a "URI" value type can expose their users to privacy
   leaks as any network access of the URI data can be tracked.  Clients
   SHOULD NOT automatically download data referenced by the URI without
   explicit instruction from users.  This specification does not
   introduce any additional privacy concerns beyond those described in
   [RFC5545].

12.  IANA Considerations

12.1.  Preference Registrations

   The following preference has been added to the HTTP Preferences
   Registry defined in [RFC7240]

   Preference:  subscribe-enhanced-get

   Value:  None.

   Optional parameters:

         value is a quoted token

         value is an integer page size

   Description:  Marks the interaction as enhanced get and provides the
      optional sync-token and page size.

   Reference:  Section 4.1

12.2.  Link Relation Registrations

   This document defines the following new iCalendar properties to be
   added to the registry defined in Section 8.2.3 of [RFC5545]:

       +------------------------+-------------+--------------------+
       | Relation Name          | Description | Reference          |
       +------------------------+-------------+--------------------+
       | subscribe-caldav       | Current     | RFCXXXX, Section 6 |
       | subscribe-caldav_auth  | Current     | RFCXXXX, Section 7 |
       | subscribe-webdav-sync  | Current     | RFCXXXX, Section 8 |
       | subscribe-enhanced_get | Current     | RFCXXXX, Section 9 |
