1.  Introduction

   Currently clients subscribe to calendar feeds as an ics file which is
   often published as a resource accessible using the unofficial
   'webcal' scheme.

   The only available option for updating that resource is the usual
   HTTP polling of cached resources using Etags.

   There is the usual tension between clients wishing to see a timely
   response to changes and servers not wishing to be overloaded by
   frequent requests for possibly large amounts of data.

   This specification introduces an approach whereby clients can
   discover a more performant access method.  Given the location of the
   resource as an ics file, the client can perfom an OPTIONS request on
   the resource and inspect the returned headers which will offer a
   number of alternative access methods.

   Given that many clients already support CalDAV this provides an easy
   upgrade path for those clients.  CalDAV and DAV subsets are specified
   here to allow lighter weight implementations.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.  Enhanced GET

2.1.  Introduction

   This is a lightweight protocol which allows simple clients to
   efficiently discover and download changes in the targeted resource.

   It has many similarities to WebDAV sync and for a server could be
   implemented as an extension of the specification.

   In this protocol the Etag is used as the sync change token.  By
   adding the If-None-Match header field to the vary header field we can
   ensure intermediate caching proxies will be able to cache different
   versions of the data.

   The resource is treated as a set of individual events each of which
   may be updated or deleted separately.  The client will first fetch
   the entire ics file.  On subsequent requests it uses the Prefer
   header with a value of "return=minimal" to indicate that it wants a
   set of changes since the last fetch.

2.2.  Deletions

   When an entity (VEVENT, VTODO or other valid top-level component) is
   deleted from the source data the server needs to be able to inform a
   client of the deletion.  This specification introduces a new value
   for the STATUS property of DELETED.

   On the first conditional GET after the entity has been deleted a
   skeleton, but valid, entity will be returned with STATUS: DELETED.
   The receiving client is free to remove the entity or update it's
   STATUS property.

   On subsequent conditional fetches the entity will not be returned.

2.3.  Examples

   This is an example of the initial request and response from a server
   that supports the extended GET protocol.

   >> Response <<

   ETag: "1234"                    current ETag (for conditional GET)

    BEGIN:VCALENDAR:
    ?  /* full feed */
    END:VCALENDAR


   This is an example of the subsequent request and response when no
   changes have occurred.  The Accept header field indicates that a
   VPATCH format is most desirable but simple text/calendar is
   acceptable.

      >> Request <<

   This is an example of the subsequent request and response when no
   changes have occurred.  The Accept header field indicates that a
   VPATCH format is most desirable but simple text/calendar is
   acceptable.

      Accept: text/calendar; q=0.5, component=VPATCH, text/calendar;

   This is an example of the subsequent request and response when
   changes have occurred and the server can create the minimal format.

   >> Request <<

   GET /events.ics HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   Accept: text/calendar; q=0.5, component=VPATCH, text/calendar;

   BEGIN:VCALENDAR:
   ...  only new/changed events
   ...  when not returning VPATCH, deleted events have STATUS:DELETED
   END:VCALENDAR


   This is an example of the subsequent request and response when
   changes have occurred and the server cannot create the minimal format
   - perhaps because of an old or invalid token.  Note there is no
   Preference-Applied header field.

3.  Changes to the iCalendar specifications

   This specification does not require any changes to [RFC5545]  or its
   extensions.  However it does introduce the use of some properties to
   provide more information about the resource, for example the time
   range it covers.

4.  Discovering alternative access methods

   The advertising of other access points is achieved through the use of
   the LINK header as defined in [RFC5988].  New link relation types are
   defined in this specification - each being associated with a protocol
   or protocol subset.

   These LINK headers will be delivered when a client carries out an
   OPTIONS request targeting the URL of the resource.

5.  Link relation subscribe-caldav

   This specifies an access point which is a full implementation of
   caldav but requires no authentication.  The end point allows the full
   range of reports as defined by the CalDAV specification.

   The client MUST follow the specification to determine exactly what
   operations are allowed on the access point - for example to determine
   if sync-report is supported.

Internet-Draft       Calendar subscription upgrades       September 2017


   The URL MAY include some form of token to allow write access to the
   targeted collection.  The client must check it's permissions to
   determine whether or not it has been granted write access.

6.  Link relation subscribe-caldav-auth

   This specifies an access point which is a full implementation of
   caldav and requires authentication.  This may allow read-write access
   to the resource.

   The client MUST follow the specification to determine exactly what
   operations are allowed on the access point - for example to determine
   if sync-report is supported.

7.  Link relation subscribe-webdav-sync

   This specifies an access point which supports only webdav sync.

   This allows the client to issue a sync-report on the resource to
   obtain updates.

   NOTE: say something about initial startup - use ics to populate?
   Initial token?

   The client MUST follow that specification.

8.  Link relation subscribe-enhanced-get

   This specifies an access point which supports something new.

   The client MUST follow that specification.

9.  Security Considerations

   Applications using these properties need to be aware of the risks
   entailed in using the URIs provided as values.  See [RFC3986] for a
   discussion of the security considerations relating to URIs.

10.  Privacy Considerations

   Properties with a "URI" value type can expose their users to privacy
   leaks as any network access of the URI data can be tracked.  Clients
   SHOULD NOT automatically download data referenced by the URI without
   explicit instruction from users.  This specification does not
   introduce any additional privacy concerns beyond those described in
   [RFC5545].

11.  IANA Considerations

11.1.  Link Relation Registrations

   This document defines the following new iCalendar properties to be
   added to the registry defined in Section 8.2.3 of [RFC5545]:

       +------------------------+-------------+--------------------+
       | Relation Name          | Description | Reference          |
       +------------------------+-------------+--------------------+
       | subscribe-caldav       | Current     | RFCXXXX, Section 5 |
       | subscribe-caldav_auth  | Current     | RFCXXXX, Section 6 |
       | subscribe-webdav-sync  | Current     | RFCXXXX, Section 7 |
       | subscribe-enhanced_get | Current     | RFCXXXX, Section 8 |
