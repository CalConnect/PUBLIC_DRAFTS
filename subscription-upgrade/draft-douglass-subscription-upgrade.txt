1.  Introduction

   Currently clients subscribe to calendar feeds as an ics file which is
   often published as a resource accessible using the unofficial
   'webcal' scheme.

   The only available option for updating that resource is the usual
   HTTP polling of cached resources using Etags.

   There is the usual tension between clients wishing to see a timely
   response to changes and servers not wishing to be overloaded by
   frequent requests for possibly large amounts of data.

   This specification introduces an approach whereby clients can
   discover a more performant access method.  Given the location of the
   resource as an ics file, the client can download the file and inspect
   the returned headers which will offer a number of alternative access
   methods.

   Given that many clients already support CalDAV this provides an easy
   upgrade path for those clients.  CalDAV and DAV subsets are specified
   here to allow lighter weight implementations.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.  Changes to the iCalendar specifications

   This speciifcation does not require any changes to [RFC5545]  or its
   extensions.  However it does introduce the use of some properties to
   provide more information about the resource, for example the time
   range it covers.

3.  Link Header

   The advertising of other access points is achieved through the use of
   the LINK header as defined in [RFC5988].  New link relation types are
   defined in this specification - each being associated with a protocol
   or protocol subset.

4.  Link relation subscribe-caldav

   This specifies an access point which is a full implementation of
   caldav but requires no authentication.  The end point is read only
   but allows the full range of reports as defined by the CalDAV
   specification.

   The client MUST follow the specification to determine exactly what
   operations are allowed on the access point - for example to determine
   if sync-report is supported.

5.  Link relation subscribe-caldav-auth

   This specifies an access point which is a full implementation of
   caldav and requires authentication.  This may allow read-write access
   to the resource.

   The client MUST follow the specification to determine exactly what
   operations are allowed on the access point - for example to determine
   if sync-report is supported.

6.  Link relation subscribe-webdav-sync

   This specifies an access point which supports only webdav sync.

   This allows the client to issue a sync-report on the resource to
   obtain updates.

   NOTE: say something about initial startup - use ics to populate?
   Initial token?

   The client MUST follow that specification.

7.  Link relation subscribe-something-else

   This specifies an access point which supports something new.

   The client MUST follow that specification.

8.  Security Considerations

   Applications using these properties need to be aware of the risks
   entailed in using the URIs provided as values.  See [RFC3986] for a
   discussion of the security considerations relating to URIs.

9.  Privacy Considerations

   Properties with a "URI" value type can expose their users to privacy
   leaks as any network access of the URI data can be tracked.  Clients
   SHOULD NOT automatically download data referenced by the URI without
   explicit instruction from users.  This specification does not
   introduce any additional privacy concerns beyond those described in
   [RFC5545].

10.  IANA Considerations

10.1.  Link Relation Registrations

   This document defines the following new iCalendar properties to be
   added to the registry defined in Section 8.2.3 of [RFC5545]:

      +--------------------------+-------------+--------------------+
      | Relation Name            | Description | Reference          |
      +--------------------------+-------------+--------------------+
      | subscribe-caldav         | Current     | RFCXXXX, Section 4 |
      | subscribe-caldav_auth    | Current     | RFCXXXX, Section 5 |
      | subscribe-webdav-sync    | Current     | RFCXXXX, Section 6 |
      | subscribe-something-else | Current     | RFCXXXX, Section 7 |
      +--------------------------+-------------+--------------------+
