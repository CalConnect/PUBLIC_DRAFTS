      <t>
        This specification introduces a number of new iCalendar properties
        and components which are of particular use for event publishers 
        and in social networking.
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification also defines a new STRUCTURED-DATA property for
        iCalendar <xref target='RFC5545'/> to allow for data  that is directly pertinent
        to an event or task to be included with the calendar data.
      </t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        The currently existing iCalendar standard <xref target='RFC5545'/> lacks
        useful methods for referencing additional, external information
        relating to calendar components. Additionally there is no standard 
        way to provide rich text descriptions or meta-data associated with 
        the event.
      </t>

      <t>
        Current practice is to embed this information as links 
        in the description or to add x-properties.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        This document defines a number of properties and a component 
        referencing such external
        information that can provide additional information about an iCalendar
        component. The intent is to allow interchange of such information between
        applications or systems (e.g., between clients, between client and  server,
        and between servers). Formats such as VCARD are likely to be
        most useful to the receivers of such events as they may be used
        in other applications - such as address books.
      </t>

      <t>The following properties are defined in this 
         specification
        <list style='hanging'>
          <t hangText="STYLED-DESCRIPTION:">
            Supports HTML descriptions.
            Event publishers typically wish to provide more and better
            formatted information about the event.
          </t>
          <t hangText="STRUCTURED-LOCATION:">
            There may be a number of locations associated with an event.
            This provides detailed information about the location.
          </t>
          <t hangText="STRUCTURED-RESOURCE:">
            Events need resources such as rooms, projectors, conferencing 
            capabilities.
          </t>
          <t hangText="STRUCTURED-DATA:">
            The existing
            properties in iCalendar cover key elements of events and tasks
            such as start time, end time, location, summary, etc. However,
            different types of events often have other specific "fields"
            that it is useful to include in the calendar data. For example,
            an event representing an airline flight could include the airline,
            flight number, departure and arrival airport codes, check-in
            and gate-closing times etc. As another example, a sporting event
            might contain information about the type of sport, the home and
            away teams, the league the teams are in, information about
            nearby parking, etc.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      
      <t>In addition this specification defines a new PARTICIPANT component. 
        Many people 
        or groups may participate in an event. This
        component provides detailed information. Such participants may
        act as attendees to the event (or derived events) or may just
        provide a reference - perhaps for mailing lists.
      </t>
      
      <section anchor="conventions" title='Conventions Used in This Document'>
        <t>
          The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
          NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
          "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
          described in <xref target='RFC2119'/>.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Components and properties">
      <t>
        Previous extensions to the calendaring standards have been largely
        restricted to the addition of properties or parameters. This is
        partly because iCalendar libraries had trouble handling components
        nested deeper than those defined in <xref target='RFC5545'/>
      </t>
      
      <t>
        In a break with this 'tradition' this specification introduces one
        of these extensions as a component rather than a property. This 
        is a better match for the way XML and JSON handles such structures
        and allows richer definitions.  
      </t>

      <t>
        It also allows for the addition of extra properties inside the
        component and resolves some of the problems of trying to add 
        detailed information as a parameter.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Typed References">
      <t>
        The properties defined here can all reference external meta-data which
        may be used by applications to
        provide enhanced value to users. By providing type information
        as parameters, clients and servers are able to discover interesting
        references and make use of them, perhaps for indexing or the
        presentation of additional related information for the user.
      </t>

      <t>
        The <xref target='RFC5545'/> LOCATION property provides only
        an unstructured single text value for specifying the location where an event
        (or task) will occur. This is inadequate for use cases where
        structured location information (e.g. address, region, country,
        postal code) is required or preferred, and limits widespread adoption of
        iCalendar in those settings.
      </t>

      <t>
        Using STRUCTURED-LOCATION, information about a number of interesting
        locations can be communicated, for example, parking, restaurants and
        the venue. Servers and clients can retrieve the objects when
        storing the event and use them to index by geographic location.
      </t>

      <t>
        When a calendar client receives a calendar component it can search the
        set of supplied properties looking for those of particular interest.
        The TYPE and FMTTYPE parameters, if supplied, can be used to help the
        selection.
      </t>

      <t>
        The PARTICIPANT component is designed to handle common use cases in
        event
        publication. It is generally important to provide information
        about the organizers of such events. Sponsors wish to be
        referenced in a prominent manner. In social calendaring it is
        often important to identify the active participants in the event,
        for example a school sports team, and the inactive participants,
        for example the parents.
      </t>

      <t>
        The PARTICIPANT component canalso be used to provide useful 
        extra daat about an attendee. For example a LOCATION property
        inside the PARTICIPANT gives the actual location of a remote
        attendee.
      </t>

      <section title="Use Cases">
        <t>
          The main motivation for these properties has been event publication but
          there are opportunities for use elsewhere. The following use cases will
          describe some possible scenarios.
        </t>

        <section title="Piano Concert Performance">
          <t>
            In putting together a concert there are many participants: piano tuner,
            performer, stage hands etc. In addition there are sponsors and various
            contacts to be provided. There will also be a number of related locations.
            A number of events can be created, all of
            which relate to the performance in different ways.
          </t>

          <t>
            There may be an iTip <xref target='RFC5546'/> meeting 
            request for the piano tuner who will arrive
            before the performance. Other members of staff may also receive meeting
            requests.
          </t>

          <t>
            An event can also be created for publication which will have a PARTICIPANT
            component for the pianist providing  a reference to vcard information about the performer.
            This event would also hold information about parking, local subway stations
            and the venue itself. In addition, there will be sponsorship information
            for sponsors of the event and perhaps paid sponsorship properties
            essentially advertising local establishments.
          </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Itineraries">
          <t>
            These additions also provide opportunities for the travel industry.
            When booking a flight the PARTICIPANT component can be used to provide
            references to businesses at the airports and to car hire businesses
            at the destination.
          </t>

          <t>
            The embedded location information can guide the traveller at the airport
            or to their final destination. The contact information can provide
            detailed information about the booking agent, the airlines and car hire
            companies and the hotel.
          </t>

              The format type and schema parameters can be specified 
              on this property and are RECOMMENDED for text or inline 
              binary encoded content information.

            <t hangText="Conformance:">
              This property can be specified multiple times in an 
              iCalendar object. Typically it would be used in "VEVENT", 
              "VTODO", or "VJOURNAL" calendar components.
            </t>
            
            <t hangText="Description:">
              This property is used to specify ancillary data in some 
              structured format either directly (inline) as a "TEXT" or 
              "BINARY" value, or as a link via a "URI" value.
            </t>

            <t>
              Rather than define new iCalendar properties
              for the variety of event types that might occur, it would be
              better to leverage existing schemas for such data.
              For example, schemas available at https://schema.org include
              different event types. By using standard schemas, interoperability
              can be improved between calendar clients and non-calendaring
              systems that wish to generate or process the data.
            </t>

            <t>
              This property allows the direct inclusion of ancillary data whose
              schema is defined elsewhere. This property also includes parameters
              to clearly identify the type of the schema being used so that
              clients can quickly and easily spot what is relevant within the
              calendar data and present that to users or process it within
              the calendaring system.
            </t>

            <t>
              iCalendar does support an "ATTACH" property which can be used
              to include documents or links to documents within the calendar
              data. However, that property does not allow data to be included
              as a "TEXT" value (a feature that "STRUCTURED-DATA" does allow),
              plus attachments are often treated as "opaque" data to be
              processed by some other system rather than the calendar client.
              Thus the existing "ATTACH" property is not sufficient to cover
              the specific needs of inclusion of schema data. Extending the
              "ATTACH" property to support a new value type would likely cause
              interoperability problems. Thus a new property to support
              inclusion of schema data is warranted.

    <section title='Security Considerations'>
      <t>
       Applications using these properties need to be aware of the risks
       entailed in using the URIs provided as values. See [RFC3986] for
       a discussion of the security considerations relating to URIs.
      </t>
      <t>
        Security considerations relating to the "ATTACH" property, as 
        described in <xref target="RFC5545" />, are applicable to the 
        "STRUCTURED-DATA" property.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title='Privacy Considerations' anchor='privacy'>
      <t>
        Properties with a "URI" value type can expose their users to 
        privacy leaks as any network access of the URI data can be 
        tracked. Clients SHOULD NOT automatically download data 
        referenced by the URI without explicit instruction from users. 
        This specification does not introduce any additional privacy 
        concerns beyond those described in <xref target="RFC5545" />.

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
