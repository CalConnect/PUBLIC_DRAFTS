Abstract

   This specification updates [RFC5545] by defining a new repeating set
   of events known as a series.  This differs from recurrences in that
   each instance is a separate entity with a parent relationship to a
   specified template entity.

1.  Introduction

   Since iCalendar was first defined there has been only one way to
   express a repeating set of events - the recurrence.  This defined a
   master event, a set of rules for computing the instances and a way of
   overriding certain instances.

   This approach works well enough in certain situations but has many
   problems which need to be addressed.

Internet-Draft              iCalendar Series               February 2017


   This specification introduces a new approach to repeating patterns of
   entities which avoids some of the problems.

2.  Overrides and iCalendar recurrences

   The recurrence rules specify how instances are to be computed.  These
   rules provide a set of keys - the RECURRENCE-ID - and an instance can
   be created with the calculated start date/time and a copy of the
   duration (or calculated end date/time).

   The specification allows for overrides.  These are handled by
   supplying a complete replacement for the instance with a RECURRENCE-
   ID property matching that of the instance being overridden.  This may
   change any of the properties (except the UID) - including start, end
   or duration.

   If a long lived recurrence is heavily overridden it becomes very
   cumbersome.  The master plus overrides is considered a single
   resource in most circumstances (iTip allows the delivery of a single
   instance in certain situations).

   Simple meetings can become heavily modifed recurrences through adding
   the weeks agenda to the description, changing of attendees etc.

   There are approaches being considered to mitigate some of these
   issues which mostly involve only storing changes but recurrences are
   still awkward to deal with.

2.1.  Changing the master start or the recurrence rules

   This can lead to some very difficult problems to resolve.  In the
   case of a heavily modified meeting it may be difficult to impossible
   to determine which override applies to the newly modified event.

   For example, a weekly book-reading is moved from Monday to Friday.
   There are weeks of scheduled events in the future.  Do we move them
   all forward to the next instance or skip one and move them back?  If
   it becomes bi-weekly rather than weekly do we drop every other or
   just space them out more?

   To be sure - some of these problems are not totally resolved by a
   series approach but they become more tractable.

2.2.  Splitting recurrences

   The [RFC5545] THISANDFUTURE range is poorly supported.  Splitting is
   what a number of implementations use to avoid changing overrrides in
   the past.



Douglass                 Expires August 19, 2017                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft              iCalendar Series               February 2017


   The recurring event is split into 2, one being the truncated original
   the other being a new recurring event starting at the time of the
   THISANDFUTURE override.

   There is left the problem of relating the two, this can be
   accomplished by use of the RELATED-TO property but that is not
   standardized.

3.  Series

   A series is a, generally regularly, repeating sets of events or tasks
   each instance of which is usually, but not always, different in some
   respect.  Examples may be a library running an after-school reading
   program which usually, takes place at the same time each week but
   always differs in the book or author being studied.

   In recurrences an instances is a calculated 'virtual' object, unless
   overridden.  It has the same UID as the master and a RECURRENCE-ID
   which is always one of the calculated set.

   In a series, a specified number of instances are created ahead of
   time each with their own unique UID.  They are all related to the
   master using a SERIES-MASTER relation type defined in this
   specification.  Each instance acts as an individual component as far
   as retrieval and searching is concerned.

   Each instance and master is identified as a member of the full series
   by the SERIES-UID property.  The value of this property is the same
   in all members of the series even when splits have occurred.

   As instances are created a LAST-SERIES-ID property is added or
   updated in the master to indicate which instance was last created.
   When there are SXDATE properties this property value may represent an
   instance which cannot be created.  It merely represents the latest
   calculated date.

   This property allows generated instances to be deleted without the
   addition of SXDATE properties to the master.  The SXDATE only
   indicates future instances which MUST NOT be created.

   As time goes on more instances are created either by the server or by
   a client when it inspects the current state of the series.  The
   number of instances may be based on time or a count.

   For example, an organization may allow rooms to be booked only 4
   weeks ahead.  Thus a series may be set up which has that 4 week set
   of events in the future.  Each will have the room as an attendee
   ensuring that at least the room is booked at the regular time.

3.1.  Modifying series patterns and splitting

   If it becomes necessary to modify the series rules or the master
   start then the series is always split at the point of the
   modification.

   When a series is split the previous master is modifed to truncate the
   current series at the last generated instance and a parameter
   SPLIT=YES is added to the series rule to indicate that this master is
   now split.

   The split may result in a number of instances related to the old
   series but overlapping the new.  It is up to the implementation to
   decide what should be done with these but this usually requires a
   degree of interaction with a human (or very intelligent robot).  The
   application may offer to copy them into the corresponding new
   instances - if these can be easily determined, offer to delete all of
   them or let the user manually copy information and delete.

   The new series master is related to the old master by the new series
   master having a RELATED-TO property with RELTYPE=SERIES-MASTER
   pointing at the previous master.  In that way a backwards chain of
   series masters may be created

3.2.  The series master

   A series master is identified in much the same way as a recurrence
   master.  It will contain an SRULE and 0 or more SDATE properties or 1
   or more SDATE properties.  Additionally it may contain 0 or more
   SXDATE properties to exclude instances.

   As noted above, if the series was split it may contain a RELATED-TO
   property with RELTYPE=SERIES-MASTER and a value of the previous
   series master.

   The master will also contain a LAST-SERIES-ID if any instances have
   been calculated and perhaps generated.

   It is important to note that the series master is the first member of
   the series.  Thus the first instance always occurs AFTER the series
   master.

3.3.  The series instances

   A series instance is identified by having a SERIES-ID property which
   is calculated in the same manner as a RECURRENCE-ID.  It MUST also
   contain a RELATED-TO property with RELTYPE=SERIES-MASTER and a value
   being the UID of the series master.

Internet-Draft              iCalendar Series               February 2017


   As noted above, if the series was split it may contain a RELATED-TO
   property with RELTYPE=SERIES-MASTER and a value being the UID of the
   previous series master.

4.  Redefined Relation Type Value

   Relationship parameter type values are defined in section 3.2.15. of
   [RFC5545].  This specification augments that parameter to include the
   new relationship values SERIES-MASTER

   Format Definition:

   This property parameter is respecified as follows:

     reltypeparam   = "RELTYPE" "="
                      ("PARENT"    ; Parent relationship - Default
                     / "CHILD"     ; Child relationship
                     / "SIBLING"   ; Sibling relationship
                     / "DEPENDS-ON" ; refers to previous task
                     / "REFID"     ; Relationship based on REFID
                     / "STRUCTURED-CATEGORY"
                             ; Relationship based on STRUCTURED-CATEGORY
                     / "FINISHTOSTART" ;  Temporal relationship
                     / "FINISHTOFINISH" ;  Temporal relationship
                     / "STARTTOFINISH" ;  Temporal relationship
                     / "STARTTOSTART" ;  Temporal relationship
                     / "SERIES-MASTER" ;  link to the master component
                     / iana-token  ; Some other IANA-registered
                                   ; iCalendar relationship type
                     / x-name)     ; A non-standard, experimental
                                   ; relationship type

   Description:  This parameter can be specified on a property that
      references another related calendar component.  The parameter may
      specify the hierarchical relationship type of the calendar
      component referenced by the property when the value is PARENT,
      CHILD or SIBLING.  If this parameter is not specified on an
      allowable property, the default relationship type is PARENT.
      Applications MUST treat x-name and iana-token values they don't
      recognize the same way as they would the PARENT value.

      This parameter defines the temporal relationship when the value is
      one of the project management standard relationships
      FINISHTOSTART, FINISHTOFINISH, STARTTOFINISH or STARTTOSTART.
      This property will be present in the predecessor entity and will
      refer to the successor entity.  The GAP parameter specifies the
      lead or lag time between the predecessor and the successor.  In
      the description of each temporal relationship below we refer to

      Task-A which contains and controls the relationship and Task-B the
      target of the relationship.

   RELTYPE=PARENT:  See [RFC5545] section 3.2.15.

   RELTYPE=CHILD:  See [RFC5545] section 3.2.15.

   RELTYPE=SIBLING:  See [RFC5545] section 3.2.15.

   RELTYPE=DEPENDS-ON:  Indicates that the current calendar component
      depends on the referenced calendar component in some manner.  For
      example a task may be blocked waiting on the other, referenced,
      task.

   RELTYPE=REFID:  Establishes a reference from the current component to
      components with a REFID property which matches the value given in
      the associated RELATED-TO property.

   RELTYPE=SERIES-MASTER:  Indicates that the current calendar component
      is bsed on the referenced calendar component.  The value is a UID.

   RELTYPE=STRUCTURED-CATEGORY:  Establishes a reference from the
      current component to components with a STRUCTURED-CATEGORY
      property which matches the value given in the associated RELATED-
      TO property.

   RELTYPE=FINISHTOSTART:  Task-B cannot start until Task-A finishes.
      For example, when sanding is complete, painting can begin.


               ============
               |  Task-A  |--+
               ============  |
                             |
                             V
                             ============
                             |  Task-B  |
                             ============

                  Figure 1: Finish to start relationship

   RELTYPE=FINISHTOFINISH:  Task-B cannot finish before Task-A is
      finished, that is the end of Task-A defines the end of Task-B.
      For example, we start the potatoes, then the meat then the peas
      but they should all be cooked at the same time.

                       ============

                  Figure 2: Finish to finish relationship

   RELTYPE=STARTTOFINISH:  The start of Task-A (which occurs after Task-
      B) controls the finish of Task-B.  For example, ticket sales
      (Task-B) end when the game starts (Task-A).

5.  New Property Parameters

5.1.  Split

   Parameter name:  SPLIT

   Purpose:  To indicate a series has been split.

   Format Definition:

Internet-Draft              iCalendar Series               February 2017


   This parameter is defined by the following notation:

                     splitparam     = "SPLIT" "="
                     ("YES"      ; The series is split
                     / "NO"      ; The series is not split (default)
                     / x-name        ; Experimental reference type
                     / iana-token)   ; Other IANA registered type

   Description:  This parameter MAY be specified on the SRULE property
      to indicate that the series has been split with SPLIT=YES.  Once
      split is is probably innapropriate to modify the series further.

5.2.  Lookahead count

   Parameter name:  LOOKAHEAD-COUNT

   Purpose:  To specify the number of series instances that should be
      generated in advance.

   Format Definition:

   This parameter is defined by the following notation:

     lookahead-countparam      = "LOOKAHEAD-COUNT" "=" 1*DIGIT

   Description:  This parameter MAY be specified on the SRULE property
      to indicate how many series instances should be generated in
      advance.

      An implementation is free to apply its own limts but MUST NOT
      generate more than those defined by this parameter and/or the
      LOOKAHEAD-PERIOD parameter.

      If both the LOOKAHEAD-PERIOD and LOOKAHEAD-COUNT arameters are
      supplied the result should be limited by both.

      For example, if the LOOKAHEAD-PERIOD parameter would cause 8
      instances to be generated but LOOKAHEAD-COUNT specifies 4 then
      only 4 instances will be generated.

5.3.  Lookahead period

   Parameter name:  LOOKAHEAD-PERIOD

   Purpose:  To specify a maximum period for which series instances
      should be generated in advance.

   Format Definition:

   This parameter is defined by the following notation:

     lookahead-periodparam      = "LOOKAHEAD-PERIOD" "="
                           DQUOTE dur-value DQUOTE

   Description:  This parameter MAY be specified on the SRULE property
      to indicate how far in advance series instances should be
      generated.

      An implementation is free to apply its own limts but MUST NOT
      generate more than those defined by this parameter and/or the
      LOOKAHEAD-COUNT parameter.

      If both the LOOKAHEAD-PERIOD and LOOKAHEAD-COUNT arameters are
      supplied the result should be limited by both.

      For example, if the LOOKAHEAD-PERIOD parameter would cause 8
      instances to be generated but LOOKAHEAD-COUNT specifies 4 then
      only 4 instances will be generated.

      The value is a quoted duration.

6.  New Properties

   The SERIES-ID, LAST-SERIES-ID, SDATE and SXDATE properties are
   identical in form and in the parameters they take.

   All must conform in form to the DTSTART property of the master
   component.  Only the SDATE may specify a time which is not part of
   the calculated series.

   The SRULE property vakue is identical in form to the RRULE property
   defined in [RFC5545].  The LOOKAHEAD-COUNT and LOOKAHEAD-PERIOD
   parameters indicate how many instances should be generated in
   advance.

6.1.  Generating Series members

   An agent, either the server or a client, will periodically extend the
   set of instances.  The number of such generated instances is limited
   by:

   Elements of the rule:  The UNTIL or COUNT parts of the rule define
      when the series terminates.  Thus a COUNT=100 specifies a maximum
      of 100 series members.






Douglass                 Expires August 19, 2017               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft              iCalendar Series               February 2017


   Lookahead count:  This specifies how many series memerbs can exist
      from the current date/time.  Thus a LOOKAHEAD-COUNT=4 means a
      maximum of 4 generated instances.

   Lookahead period:  This specifies how far into the future series
      members can be generated.  Thus a LOOKAHEAD-PERIOD="PT2M" means a
      maximum period of 2 months.

   System limits:  This client or server SHOULD also apply limits to
      prevent a series from generating an overlarge set of members.

   The starting point for the calculation is the DTSTART of the master
   component or the LAST-SERIES-ID if it exists in the master.  In both
   cases the instance represented by that date is NOT generated as part
   of the intance set and the actual instance may have been excluded by
   an SXDATE property but the starting date is still valid.

   The starting date/time property defines the first instance in the
   next batch of series members.  Note that the starting property value
   MUST match the pattern of the series rule, if specified.  For
   example, if the rule specifies every Wednesday the starting date MUST
   be a Wednesday.

   The end date/time of the set will be provided by the UNTIL part of
   the rule, the LOOKAHEAD-PERIOD or by a system maxima.

   A set of date/time values can be generated within those contraints.
   As each date/time value is generated it can be ignored if it is one
   of the SXDATE values.

   Generation of values can terminate when the size of the result
   exceeds that given by the COUNT rule element, the LOOKAHEAD-COUNT
   value or any systm limit.

   Any SDATE values that fall within the current range and are not in
   the set of SXDATE values can be added and the result truncated again
   to match the size limits.

   Finally, any date/time values that have already been generated and
   are present as SERIES-ID values should be removed from the set.  What
   remains is the new set of members to extend the current series.

   The last of those values becomes the new value for the LAST-SERIES-ID
   property in the series master.

   As noted above the "SXDATE" property can be used to exclude the value
   specified in the master.  This leads to a complication as the master
   needs to be preserved as a container for the values which define the

6.5.  Series-id

   Property name:  SERIES-ID

   Purpose:  This property is used in conjunction with the "UID" and
      "SEQUENCE" properties to identify a specific instance of a
      "VEVENT", "VTODO", or "VJOURNAL" calendar component in a series.
      The property value is the original value of the "DTSTART" property
      of the series instance before any changes occur.

   Value type:  The default value type is DATE-TIME.  The value type can
      be set to a DATE value type.  This property MUST have the same
      value type as the "DTSTART" property contained within the series
      component.  Furthermore, this property MUST be specified as a date
      with local time if and only if the "DTSTART" property contained
      within the series component is specified as a date with local
      time.

   Property Parameters:  IANA, non-standard, value data type and time
      zone identifier parameters can be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified zero or more times in
      any iCalendar component.

   Description:  The SERIES-ID is the originally calculated value of the
      DTSTART property based on the master identified by the RELATED-TO
      property with a RELTYPE=SERIES-MASTER parameter.

      The full series of components can only be retrieved by searching
      for all components with a matching RELATED-TO property.

      If the value of the "DTSTART" property is a DATE type value, then
      the value MUST be the calendar date for the series instance.

      The DATE-TIME value is set to the time when the original series
      instance would occur; meaning that if the intent is to change a

      Friday meeting to Thursday, the DATE-TIME is still set to the
      original Friday meeting.

      The "SERIES-ID" property is used in conjunction with the "UID" and
      "SEQUENCE" properties to identify a particular instance of an
      event, to-do, or journal in the series.  For a given pair of "UID"
      and "SEQUENCE" property values, the "SERIES-ID" value for a series
      instance is fixed.

   Purpose:  To specify the last calculated instance of the series.
      When new instances are created they MUST have a SERIES-ID after
      the value of this property.

      In all respects this property is identical to SERIES-ID and is in
      fact a copy of the SERIES-ID which would be present in the last
      created instance (assuming it is not suppressed by an SXDATE).

   Value type:  DATE or DATE_TIME (the default).  This has the same
      requirements as SERIES-ID.

   Property Parameters:  IANA, non-standard, value data type and time
      zone identifier parameters can be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property MAY be specified in any iCalendar
      component.

   Description:  When used in a component the value of this property

6.7.  Series Rule

   Property name:  RRULE

   Purpose:  This property defines a rule or repeating pattern for a
      series of events, to-dos or journal entries.

   Value Type:  RECUR

   Property Parameters:  IANA, non-standard, look-ahead count or date
      property parameters can be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified in any "VEVENT",
      "VTODO", and "VJOURNAL" calendar component, but it SHOULD NOT be
      specified more than once.

   Description:  The series rule, if specified, is used in computing the
      instances to be generated for the series.  These are generated by
      considering the master "DTSTART" property along with the "SRULE",
      "SDATE", and "SXDATE" properties contained within the series
      master.  The "DTSTART" property defines the first instance in the
      recurrence set which is represented by that master event.

      Unlike the RRULE the "DTSTART" property MUST be synchronized with
      the series rule, if specified.  For example, if the DTSTARTS
      species a date on Wednesday but the SRULE speciee every Tuesday
      then a server or client MUSt reject the component.

      The final series is represented by gathering all of the start
      DATE-TIME values generated by any of the specified "SRULE" and
      "SDATE" properties, and then excluding any start DATE-TIME values
      specified by "SXDATE" properties.  This implies that start DATE-
      TIME values specified by "SXDATE" properties take precedence over
      those specified by inclusion properties (i.e., "SDATE" and
      "SRULE").  Where duplicate instances are generated by the "SRULE"
      and "SDATE" properties, only one imstance is considered.
      Duplicate instances are ignored.

      The "DTSTART" property specified within the master iCalendar
      object defines the first instance of the recurrence.  In most
      cases, a "DTSTART" property of DATE-TIME value type used with a
      series rule, should be specified as a date with local time and
      time zone reference to make sure all the recurrence instances
      start at the same local time regardless of time zone changes.

      If the duration of the series component is specified with the
      "DTEND" or "DUE" property, then the same exact duration will apply
      to all the members of the generated series.  Else, if the duration

Internet-Draft              iCalendar Series               February 2017


      of the series master component is specified with the "DURATION"
      property, then the same nominal duration will apply to all the
      members of the generated series and the exact duration of each
      instance will depend on its specific start time.  For example,
      series instances of a nominal duration of one day will have an
      exact duration of more or less than 24 hours on a day where a time
      zone shift occurs.  The duration of a specific instance may be
      modified in an exception component or simply by using an "SDATE"
      property of PERIOD value type.

   Format Definition:

   This property is defined by the following notation:

     srule      = "SRULE" srulparam ":" recur CRLF

     sruleparam = *(
                   ; the following are OPTIONAL
                   ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                   (";" lookahead-countparam) /

                   (";" xparam)

      params

7.  Redefined RELATED-TO Property

7.1.  RELATED-TO

   Property name:  RELATED-TO

   Purpose:  This property is used to represent a relationship or
      reference between one calendar component and others.  The
      definition here extends the definition in Section 3.8.4.5. of
      [RFC5545] by including a section on RELTYPE=SERIES-MASTER.

   Value type:  URI, UID or TEXT

Internet-Draft              iCalendar Series               February 2017


   Property Parameters:  Relationship type, IANA and non-standard
      property parameters can be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property MAY be specified in any iCalendar
      component.

   Description:  By default or when VALUE=UID is specified, the property
      value consists of the persistent, globally unique identifier of
      another calendar component.  This value would be represented in a
      calendar component by the "UID" property.

      By default, the property value points to another calendar
      component that has a PARENT relationship to the referencing
      object.  The "RELTYPE" property parameter is used to either
      explicitly state the default PARENT relationship type to the
      referenced calendar component or to override the default PARENT
      relationship type and specify either a CHILD or SIBLING
      relationship or a temporal relationship.

      The PARENT relationship indicates that the calendar component is a
      subordinate of the referenced calendar component.  The CHILD
      relationship indicates that the calendar component is a superior
      of the referenced calendar component.  The SIBLING relationship
      indicates that the calendar component is a peer of the referenced
      calendar component.

      The FINISHTOSTART, FINISHTOFINISH, STARTTOFINISH or STARTTOSTART
      relationships define temporal relationships as specified in the
      reltype parameter definition.

      The SERIES-MASTER relationship when included in a series instance
      refers to the master of that series.  When included in a series
      master it refers to a previous master in a chain of spilt series.

      Changes to a calendar component referenced by this property can
      have an implicit impact on the related calendar component.  For
      example, if a group event changes its start or end date or time,
      then the related, dependent events will need to have their start
      and end dates changed in a corresponding way.  Similarly, if a
      PARENT calendar component is cancelled or deleted, then there is

      calendar system to maintain any property implications of this
      relationship.

   This property is defined by the following notation:

     related    = "RELATED-TO" relparam ( ":" text ) /
                  (
                    ";" "VALUE" "=" "UID"
                    ":" uid
                  )
                  (
                    ";" "VALUE" "=" "URI"
                    ":" uri
                  )
                  CRLF

     relparam   = *(
                 ;
                 ; The following are OPTIONAL,
                 ; but MUST NOT occur more than once.
                 ;
                 (";" reltypeparam) /
                 (";" gapparam) /
                 ;
                 ; The following is OPTIONAL,
                 ; and MAY occur more than once.
                 ;
                 (";" other-param)
                 ;
                 )

8.  Backwards compatibility

   Any clients following the approach specified in [RFC5545] are
   expected to ignore any properties or parameters they don't recognize.

   For such clients the series appears to be an unconnected set of
   components.  They all have their own unique UIDS.  If the client
   updates an instance this should be identical in effect to an update
   carried out by a client aware of the new properties.

   Updates MUST preserve the SERIES-ID, LAST-SERIES-ID, SRULE, SDATE and
   SXDATE properties.  A client which does not do so is in violation of
   [RFC5545].

9.  CalDAV extensions

   This specification may extend Caldav by adding reports to return all
   members of a series given the series master UID.  This could be
   handled by the current query mechganism but it is likely to be
   sufficiently frequently used that a special query is appropriate.

   It is also likely we will want a CalDAV operation to split a series
   and generate the additional members of the series as a single atomic
   operation.

10.  Security Considerations

   Clients and servers should take care to limit the number of generated
   instances to a reasonable value.  This can be a relatively small
   value.

Appendix A.  Points for discussion

   Detecting changes from old clients:  If such a client updates
      properties in the master ... what do we say here?  Is there a way
      we can determine that the client doesn't realize that it's a
      series?  If it doesn't then updating the dtstart is a big deal -
      maybe we add a parameter to a dtstart update to indicate the
      client knows it's a series but wants to do so anyway.

      Or perhaps we add a new operation - or extend patch.  Simple
      update returns FORBIDDEN if you try to change any of the important
      properties (should do that for recurrences) and requires an
      explicit flag to say you (think you) know what you're doing.

   Splitting and linking:  The spec currently only allows for backward
      linking to previous masters.  There is a parameter added to the
      rule SPLIT=YES to indicate that the series was split

      It makes sense to have a forward link to the new(er) series.
      However, a client/server may not know what the UID is until after
      data is stored.  The new chain can be determined vis a query so

      perhaps we can leave it up to the protocols to figure out that
      mechanism.

   CalDAV queries:  if there were a better more generalised query
      language such an extensions might be unnecessary.  Should we
      define a query language specifically for calendaring?
