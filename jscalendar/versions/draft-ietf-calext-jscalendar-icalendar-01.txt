1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation

   The JSCalendar [draft-ietf-calext-jscalendar] data format is used to
   represent calendar data, and is meant as an alternative to the widely
   deployed iCalendar [RFC5545] data format.

   While new calendaring services and applications might use JSCalendar
   as their main data format to exchange calendaring data, they are
   likely to interoperate with services and clients that just support
   iCalendar.  Similarly, existing calendaring data is stored in
   iCalendar format in databases and other calendar stores, and
   providers and users might want to represent this data also in
   JSCalendar.  Lastly, some implementations might want to preserve
   custom iCalendar properties, that have no equivalent in JSCalendar
   when converting between these formats.

   To facilitate these use cases, this document provides an
   informational guide how to convert JSCalendar data from and to
   iCalendar.

1.2.  Scope and caveats

   JSCalendar and iCalendar have a lot of semantics in common, but they
   are not interchangeable formats:

   o  JSCalendar contains a richer data model to express calendar
      information such as event locations and participants; while future
      iCalendar extensions may allow a direct mapping, for now there may
      be no representation directly in iCalendar of some properties and
      these have been marked as implementation specific for mapping.

   o  iCalendar may contain arbitrary, non-standardised data with custom
      properties/attributes.  Translating these into JSCalendar is
      implementation specific.

   o  iCalendar has some obsolete features that have been removed from
      JSCalendar due to not being useful and/or supported in the real
      world (e.g. custom email alerts to send to random people).
      Translating these may lose some of the original fidelity.

   o  Implementations may use a custom property to store data that could
      not be mapped directly in either direction in the original or a
      custom format, however this is not interoperable.

   Accordingly, this document does not standardize a canonical
   translation between iCalendar and JSCalendar, and implementations
   MUST NOT make any assumptions how iCalendar data is represented in
   JSCalendar by other systems.

1.3.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  New iCalendar parameters

2.1.  SUBSECOND parameter

   Parameter name:  SUBSECOND

   Purpose:  This parameter is used to define fractional seconds for
      time values and durations.  SUBSECOND MUST NOT be used in date-
      time calculations or comparisons in  iCalendar.  It is meant to
      preserve time precision on time values and duration with sub-
      second precision, without increasing the time value range within
      iCalendar.

   Description:  This parameter MAY be specified on properties of type
      DATE-TIME or DURATION.  The integral part of the float value MUST
      be zero.  The value MUST NOT be negative.  iCalendar
      implementations SHOULD ignore this parameter in date time
      arithmetic.  Implementations MUST ignore presence of the SUBSECOND
      parameter on RECURRENCE-ID properties when determining recurrence
      overrides.  If present on a RECURRENCE-ID property, its value MUST
      match the SUBSECOND parameter value on the DATE-TIME property that
      defines the reference point for the recurring instances.

   Format Definition:

   This parameter is defined by the following notation:

                                       subsecond-param = float

   Example:  DTSTART;SUBSECOND=0.03:20190605T133015

3.  JSEvent

   A JSEvent maps to the the iCalendar VEVENT component type [RFC5545].
   The following tables maps the JSEvent-specific properties to
   iCalendar:

   +----------+--------------------------------------------------------+
   | Property | iCalendar counterpart                                  |
   +----------+--------------------------------------------------------+
   | duration | DURATION property.  If the VEVENT contains a DTEND     |
   |          | property, the this maps to the duration property as    |
   |          | the time span between DTSTART and DTEND when           |
   |          | converting the respective time points to the UTC time  |
   |          | zone.  Fractional seconds SHOULD be preserved with the |
   |          | SUBSECOND parameter.                                   |
   +----------+--------------------------------------------------------+

4.  JSTask

   A JSTask object maps to the iCalendar VTODO component type [RFC5545].
   The following tables maps the JSTask-specific properties to
   iCalendar:

   | statusUpdatedAt   | COMPLETED property. The JSTask status         |

           Table 4: Translation between JSCalendar and iCalendar

6.1.  Time properties and types

   iCalendar defines two different time types, DATE and DATE-TIME, where
   the latter may occur in three forms (with local time, with UTC time,
   with local time and time zone reference).  In contrast, JSCalendar
   does not define a distinct type for dates, and date times are defined
   with the LocalDateTime type only.

   A JSCalendar time maps to the iCalendar DATE type if all of the
   following criteria apply:

   o  The "start" ("due") property value has zero time, or is not set.

   o  The "duration" ("estimatedDuration") property value has zero time,
      or is a multiple of days or weeks, or is not set.

   o  The "timeZone" property value is null, or is not set.

   For all other cases, the time maps to an iCalendar DATE-TIME:

   o  With local time and time zone reference, if the "timeZone"
      property value is set and does not equal "Etc/UTC".

   o  With UTC time, if the "timeZone" property value equals "Etc/UTC".

   o  With local time, if the "timeZone" property value is null or not
      set.

   Fractional seconds SHOULD be preserved with the SUBSECOND parameter.

6.2.  Locations

   The iCalendar counterpart for JSCalendar Location objects is the
   iCalendar [RFC5545] LOCATION property, or implementation-specific.

6.3.  Participants

   The following table outlines translation of JSCalendar participants.
   An iCalendar ORGANIZER maps to both the replyTo property and a
   participant with role "owner".  If an ATTENDEE with the same CAL-
   ADDRESS value exists, then it maps to the same participant as the
   ORGANIZER participant.  Other participants map to ATTENDEEs.

7.  Custom properties

   Mapping custom or unknown properties between JSCalendar and iCalendar
   is implementation-specific.  Implementations might use vendor-
   extension properties, which could also serve as basis for discussion
   for a JSCalendar standard extension.  Alternatively, an
   implementation could preserve iCalendar properties and components in
   JSCalendar by use of a vendor-extension property formatted as jCal
   [RFC7265] data.

8.  Security Considerations

   The same security considerations as for
   [draft-ietf-calext-jscalendar] apply.

9.  IANA Considerations

   None.
