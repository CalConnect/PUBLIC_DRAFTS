1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation

   The JSCalendar [draft-ietf-calext-jscalendar] data format is used to
   represent calendar data, and is meant as an alternative to the widely
   deployed iCalendar [RFC5545] data format.

   While new calendaring services and applications might use JSCalendar
   as their main data format to exchange calendaring data, they are
   likely to interoperate with services and clients that just support
   iCalendar.  Similarly, existing calendaring data is stored in
   iCalendar format in databases and other calendar stores, and
   providers and users might want to represent this data also in
   JSCalendar.  Lastly, some implementations might want to preserve
   custom iCalendar properties, that have no equivalent in JSCalendar
   when converting between these formats.

   To facilitate these use cases, this document provides an
   informational guide how to convert JSCalendar data from and to
   iCalendar.

1.2.  Scope and caveats

   JSCalendar and iCalendar have a lot of semantics in common, but they
   are not interchangeable formats:

   o  JSCalendar contains a richer data model to express calendar
      information such as event locations and participants; while future
      iCalendar extensions may allow a direct mapping, for now there may
      be no representation directly in iCalendar of some properties and
      these have been marked as implementation specific for mapping.

   o  iCalendar may contain arbitrary, non-standardised data with custom
      properties/attributes.  Translating these into JSCalendar is
      implementation specific.

   o  iCalendar has some obsolete features that have been removed from
      JSCalendar due to not being useful and/or supported in the real
      world (e.g. custom email alerts to send to random people).
      Translating these may lose some of the original fidelity.

   o  Implementations may use a custom property to store data that could
      not be mapped directly in either direction in the original or a
      custom format, however this is not interoperable.

   Accordingly, this document does not standardize a canonical
   translation between iCalendar and JSCalendar, and implementations
   MUST NOT make any assumptions how iCalendar data is represented in
   JSCalendar by other systems.

1.3.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  JSEvent

   A _JSEvent_ maps to the the iCalendar VEVENT component type
   [RFC5545].  The following tables maps the JSEvent-specific properties
   to iCalendar:

   +----------+--------------------------------------------------------+
   | duration | DURATION property.  If the VEVENT contains a DTEND     |
   |          | property, the this maps to the _duration_ property as  |
   |          | the time span between DTSTART and DTEND when           |
   |          | converting the respective time points to the UTC time  |
   |          | zone.                                                  |

3.  JSTask

   A _JSTask_ object maps to the iCalendar VTODO component type
   [RFC5545].  The following tables maps the JSTask-specific properties
   to iCalendar:

   | estimatedDuration | ESTIMATED-DURATION property in the RFC draft  |
   |                   | [draft-apthorp-ical-tasks], or the DURATION   |
   |                   | property otherwise.                           |

   | statusUpdatedAt   | COMPLETED property. The JSTask status         |
   |                   | property MUST have value "completed".         |
   |                   |                                               |

   |                   | the definitions in the RFC draft              |
   |                   | [draft-apthorp-ical-tasks].                   |

   This section contains recommendations how to map JSCalendar from and
   to iCalendar.  It lists all common JSCalendar object properties in
   alphabetical order.

   |                        | map to the "display" action. An EMAIL    |
   |                        | value maps to a JSCalendar "email"       |

5.1.  Time

   JSEvent and JSTask objects share the _start_, _timeZone_ and
   _isAllDay_ properties to express their occurrence in time.  The
   following table defines how to map these properties:

5.3.  Participants

   The following table outlines translation of JSCalendar participants.
   An iCalendar ORGANIZER maps to _replyTo_ and a participant with role
   "owner".  If an ATTENDEE with the same CAL-ADDRESS value exists, then
   it maps to the same participant as the ORGANIZER participant.  Other
   participants map to ATTENDEEs.

6.  Custom properties

   Mapping custom or unknown properties between JSCalendar and iCalendar
   is implementation-specific.  Implementations might use vendor-
   extension properties, which could also serve as basis for discussion
   for a JSCalendar standard extension.  Alternatively, an
   implementation could preserve iCalendar properties and components in
   JSCalendar by use of a vendor-extension property formatted as jCal
   [RFC7265] data.

7.  Security Considerations

   The same security considerations as for
   [draft-ietf-calext-jscalendar] apply.

8.  IANA Considerations

   None.

9.  Acknowledgments

   The authors would like to thank the members of CalConnect for their
   valuable contributions.  This specification originated from the work
