This specification defines a JSON representation of calendar data
that can be used for storage and data exchange in a calendaring and
scheduling environment.  It aims to be an alternative to the widely
deployed iCalendar data format and to be unambiguous, extendable and
simple to process.

The associated CalConnect technical committee is TC-API.
