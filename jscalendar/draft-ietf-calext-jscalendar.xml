      <t>This specification defines a data model and JSON representation of calendar data that can be used for storage and data exchange in a calendaring and scheduling environment. It aims to be an alternative, and over time successor to, the widely deployed iCalendar data format and to be unambiguous, extendable and simple to process. In contrast to the JSON-based jCal format, it is not a direct mapping from iCalendar and expands semantics where appropriate.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>This document defines a data model for calendar event and task objects, or groups of such objects, in electronic calendar applications and systems. It aims to be unambiguous, extendable and simple to process.</t>

      <t>The key design considerations for this data model are as follows:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>The attributes of the calendar entry represented must be described as a simple key-value pair. Simple events are simple to represent, complex events can be modelled accurately.</t>
          <t>Wherever possible, there should be only one way to express the desired semantics, reducing complexity.</t>
          <t>The data model should avoid ambiguities and make it difficult to make mistakes during implementation.</t>
          <t>The data model should be compatible with the iCalendar data format <xref target="RFC5545" /> <xref target="RFC7986" /> and extensions, but the specification should add new attributes where the iCalendar format currently lacks expressivity, and drop widely unused, obsolete or redundant properties. This means translation with no loss of semantics should be easy with most common iCalendar files but is not guaranteed with the full specification.</t>
          <t>Extensions, such as new properties and components, MUST NOT lead to requiring an update to this document.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>The representation of this data model is defined in the I-JSON format <xref target="RFC7493" />, which is a strict subset of the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format <xref target="RFC8259" />. Using JSON is mostly a pragmatic choice: its widespread use makes JSCalendar easier to adopt, and the ready availability of production-ready JSON implementations eliminates a whole category of parser-related interoperability issues, which iCalendar has often suffered from.</t>

      <section anchor="relation-to-icalendar" title="Motivation and Relation to iCalendar and jCal">
        <t>The iCalendar data format <xref target="RFC5545" />, a widely deployed interchange format for calendaring and scheduling data, has served calendaring vendors for a long while, but contains some ambiguities and pitfalls that can not be overcome without backward-incompatible changes.</t>

        <t>For example, iCalendar defines various formats for local times, UTC time and dates, which confuses new users and often leads to implementation errors. Other sources for errors are the requirement for custom time zone definitions within a single calendar component, as well as the iCalendar format itself; the latter causing interoperability issues due to misuse of CR LF terminated strings, line continuations and subtle differences between iCalendar parsers. The definition of recurrence rules is ambiguous and has resulted in differing understandings even between experienced calendar developers.</t>

        <t>In recent years, many new products and services have appeared that wish to use a JSON representation of calendar data within their API. The JSON format for iCalendar data, <xref target="RFC7265">jCal</xref>, is a direct mapping between iCalendar and JSON. In its effort to represent full iCalendar semantics, it inherits all the same pitfalls and uses a complicated JSON structure unlike most common JSON data representations.</t>

        <t>As a consequence, since the standardization of jCal, the majority of implementations and service providers either kept using iCalendar, or came up with their own proprietary JSON representations, which are incompatible with each other and often suffer from common pitfalls, such as storing event start times in UTC (which become incorrect if the timezone's rules change in the future). JSCalendar is intended to meet this demand for JSON-formatted calendar data, and to provide a standard, elegant representation as an alternative to new proprietary formats.</t>

      <section anchor="notational-conventions" title="Notational Conventions">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119" />.</t>

        <t>The underlying format used for this specification is JSON. Consequently, the terms "object" and "array" as well as the four primitive types (strings, numbers, booleans, and null) are to be interpreted as described in Section 1 of <xref target="RFC8259" />.</t>

        <t>Some examples in this document contain "partial" JSON documents used for illustrative purposes. In these examples, three periods "..." are used to indicate a portion of the document that has been removed for compactness.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="type-signatures" title="Type Signatures">
        <t>Type signatures are given for all JSON values in this document. The following conventions are used:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
          <t><spanx style="verb">*</spanx> - The type is undefined (the value could be any type, although permitted values may be constrained by the context of this value).</t>
          <t><spanx style="verb">String</spanx> - The JSON string type.</t>
          <t><spanx style="verb">Number</spanx> - The JSON number type.</t>
          <t><spanx style="verb">Boolean</spanx> - The JSON boolean type.</t>
          <t><spanx style="verb">A[B]</spanx> - A JSON object where the keys are all of type <spanx style="verb">A</spanx>, and the values are all of type <spanx style="verb">B</spanx>.</t>
          <t><spanx style="verb">A[]</spanx> - An array of values of type
            <spanx style="verb">A</spanx>.</t>
          <t><spanx style="verb">A|B</spanx> - The value is either of type
            <spanx style="verb">A</spanx> or of type
            <spanx style="verb">B</spanx>.</t>
        </list></t>

        <t>Other types may also be given, with their representation defined elsewhere in this document.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="data-types" title="Data Types">
        <t>In addition to the standard JSON data types, the following data types are used in this specification:</t>

        <section anchor="type-Int" title="Int">
          <t>Where <spanx style="verb">Int</spanx> is given as a data type, it means an integer in the range -2^53+1 &lt;= value &lt;= 2^53-1, the safe range for integers stored in a floating-point double, represented as a JSON <spanx style="verb">Number</spanx>.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="type-UnsignedInt" title="UnsignedInt">
          <t>Where <spanx style="verb">UnsignedInt</spanx> is given as a data type, it means an <spanx style="verb">Int</spanx> where the value MUST be in the range 0 &lt;= value &lt;= 2^53-1.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="type-UTCDateTime" title="UTCDateTime">
          <t>This is a string in <xref target="RFC3339" /> <spanx style="verb">date-time</spanx> format, with the further restrictions that any letters MUST be in uppercase, the time component MUST be included and the time offset MUST be the character <spanx style="verb">Z</spanx>. Fractional second values MUST NOT be included unless non-zero and MUST NOT have trailing zeros, to ensure there is only a single representation for each date-time. </t>

          <t>For example <spanx style="verb">2010-10-10T10:10:10.003Z</spanx> is OK, but <spanx style="verb">2010-10-10T10:10:10.000Z</spanx> is invalid and MUST be encoded as <spanx style="verb">2010-10-10T10:10:10Z</spanx>.</t>

          <t>In common notation, it should be of the form <spanx style="verb">YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ</spanx>.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="type-LocalDateTime" title="LocalDateTime">
          <t>This is a date-time string with no time zone/offset information. It is otherwise in the same format as UTCDateTime, including fractional seconds. For example <spanx style="verb">2006-01-02T15:04:05</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">2006-01-02T15:04:05.003</spanx> are both valid. The time zone to associate the LocalDateTime with comes from an associated property, or if no time zone is associated it defines <spanx style="strong">floating time</spanx>. Floating date-times are not tied to any specific time zone. Instead, they occur in every time zone at the same wall-clock time (as opposed to the same instant point in time).</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="type-Duration" title="Duration">
          <t>Where Duration is given as a type, it means a length of time represented by a subset of ISO8601 duration format, as specified by the following ABNF:</t>

          <figure>
            <artwork><![CDATA[    dur-secfrac = "." 1*DIGIT
    dur-second  = 1*DIGIT [dur-secfrac] "S"
    dur-minute  = 1*DIGIT "M" [dur-second]
    dur-hour    = 1*DIGIT "H" [dur-minute]
    dur-time    = "T" (dur-hour / dur-minute / dur-second)
    dur-day     = 1*DIGIT "D"
    dur-week    = 1*DIGIT "W"

    duration    = "P" (dur-day [dur-time] / dur-time / dur-week)]]></artwork>
          </figure>

          <t>In addition, the duration MUST NOT include fractional second values unless the fraction is non-zero.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="type-SignedDuration" title="SignedDuration">
          <t>A SignedDuration represents a length of time that may be positive or negative and is typically used to express the offset of a point in time relative to an associated time. It is represented as a Duration, optionally preceded by a sign character. It is specified by the following ABNF:</t>

          <figure>
            <artwork><![CDATA[    signed-duration = (["+"] / "-") duration]]></artwork>
          </figure>

          <t>A negative sign indicates a point in time at or before the associated time, a positive or no sign a time at or after the associated time.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="type-Id" title="Id">
          <t>Where <spanx style="verb">Id</spanx> is given as a data type, it means a <spanx style="verb">String</spanx> of at least 1 and a maximum of 255 octets in size, and it MUST only contain characters from the "URL and Filename Safe" base64 alphabet, as defined in Section 5 of <xref target="RFC4648" />, excluding the pad character (<spanx style="verb">=</spanx>). This means the allowed characters are the ASCII alphanumeric characters (<spanx style="verb">A-Za-z0-9</spanx>), hyphen (<spanx style="verb">-</spanx>), and underscore (<spanx style="verb">_</spanx>).</t>

          <t>Unless otherwise specified, Ids are arbitrary and only have meaning within the object where they are being used. Ids need not be unique between different objects. For example, two JSEvent objects MAY use the same ids in their respective <spanx style="verb">links</spanx> properties. Or within the same JSEvent object the same Id could appear in the <spanx style="verb">participants</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">alerts</spanx> properties. This does not imply any semantic connection between the two. <vspace blankLines="1" /> Nevertheless, a UUID is typically a good choice.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="type-PatchObject" title="PatchObject">
          <t>A PatchObject is of type <spanx style="verb">String[*]</spanx>, and represents an unordered set of patches on a JSON object. The keys are a path in a subset of <xref target="RFC6901" /> JSON pointer format, with an implicit leading <spanx style="verb">/</spanx> (i.e. prefix each key with <spanx style="verb">/</spanx> before applying the JSON pointer evaluation algorithm).</t>

          <t>A patch within a PatchObject is only valid if all of the following conditions apply:</t>

          <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>The pointer MUST NOT reference inside an array (i.e. it MUST NOT insert/delete from an array; the array MUST be replaced in its entirety instead).</t>
            <t>When evaluating a path, all parts prior to the last (i.e. the value after the final slash) MUST exist.</t>
            <t>There MUST NOT be two patches in the PatchObject where the pointer of one is the prefix of the pointer of the other, e.g. <spanx style="verb">alerts/foo/offset</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">alerts</spanx>.</t>
          </list></t>

          <t>The value associated with each pointer is either:
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>null: Remove the property from the patched object. If not present in the parent, this a no-op.</t>
              <t>Anything else: The value to set for this property (this may be a replacement or addition to the object being patched).</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>Implementations MUST reject a PatchObject if any of its patches are invalid.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="timezones" title="Time Zones">
          <t>By default, time zones in JSCalendar are identified by their name in the <eref target="https://www.iana.org/time-zones">IANA Time Zone Database</eref>, and the zone rules of the respective zone record apply.</t>

          <t>Implementations MAY embed the definition of custom time zones in the <spanx style="verb">timeZones</spanx> property (see <xref target="prop-timeZones" />).</t>
         </section>
         <section anchor="type-Relation" title="Relation">
             <t>A Relation object defines the relation to other objects, using a possibly empty set of relation types. The object that defines this relation is the linking object, the other object is the linked object. The Relation object has the following property:</t>
             <t><list style="symbols">
                     <t>@type: <spanx style="verb">String</spanx> (mandatory)
                         <vspace blankLines="1" />
                         Specifies the type of this object. This MUST be <spanx style="verb">Relation</spanx>.
                     </t>
                     <t>relation: <spanx style="verb">String[Boolean]</spanx> (optional, default: empty Object)
                         <vspace blankLines="1" />
                         Describes how the linked object is related to the linking object. The relation is defined as a set of relation types. If empty, the relationship between the two objects is unspecified.
                         <vspace blankLines="1" />
                         Keys in the set MUST be one of the following values, or specified in the property definition where the Relation object is used, or an IANA-registered value, or a vendor-specific value:
                         <list style="symbols">
                             <t><spanx style="verb">first</spanx>: The linked object is the first in a series the linking object is part of.</t>
                             <t><spanx style="verb">next</spanx>: The linked object is the next in a series the linking object is part of.</t>
                             <t><spanx style="verb">child</spanx>: The linked object is a subpart of the linking object.</t>
                             <t><spanx style="verb">parent</spanx>: The linking object is part of the overall linked object.</t>
                         </list>
                         The value for each key in the set MUST be true.</t>
             </list></t>
             <t>Note, the Relation object only has one property (except @type); it is specified as an object with a single property to allow for extension in the future.</t>

    <section anchor="jscalendar-objects" title="JSCalendar Objects">
      <t>This section describes the calendar object types specified by JSCalendar.</t>

      <section anchor="jsevent" title="JSEvent">
        <t>MIME type: <spanx style="verb">application/jscalendar+json;type=jsevent</spanx></t>

        <t>A JSEvent represents a scheduled amount of time on a calendar, typically a meeting, appointment, reminder or anniversary. Multiple participants may partake in the event at multiple locations.</t>

        <t>The <xref target="prop-type">@type</xref> property value MUST be <spanx style="verb">jsevent</spanx>.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="jstask" title="JSTask">
        <t>MIME type: <spanx style="verb">application/jscalendar+json;type=jstask</spanx></t>

        <t>A JSTask represents an action-item, assignment, to-do or work item.</t>

        <t>The <xref target="prop-type">@type</xref> property value MUST be <spanx style="verb">jstask</spanx>.</t>

        <t>A JSTask may start and be due at certain points in time, may take some estimated time to complete and may recur; none of which is required. This notably differs from <xref target="jsevent">JSEvent</xref> which is required to start at a certain point in time and typically takes some non-zero duration to complete.</t>

        <t>A JSGroup is a collection of <xref target="jsevent">JSEvent</xref> and/or <xref target="jstask">JSTask</xref> objects. Typically, objects are grouped by topic (e.g. by keywords) or calendar membership.</t>

        <t>The <xref target="prop-type">@type</xref> property value MUST be <spanx style="verb">jsgroup</spanx>.</t>

    <section anchor="structure-of-jscalendar-objects" title="Structure of JSCalendar Objects">
      <t>A JSCalendar object is a JSON object, which MUST be valid I-JSON (a stricter subset of JSON), as specified in <xref target="RFC8259" />. Property names and values are case-sensitive.</t>

      <t>The object has a collection of properties, as specified in the following sections. Properties are specified as being either mandatory or optional. Optional properties may have a default value, if explicitly specified in the property definition.</t>

      <section anchor="normalization" title="Normalization and Equivalence">
        <t>JSCalendar aims to provide unambiguous definitions for value types and properties, but does not define a general normalization or equivalence method for JSCalendar objects and types. This is because the notion of equivalence might range from byte-level equivalence to semantic equivalence, depending on the respective use case (for example, the CalDAV protocol <xref target="RFC4791" /> requires octet equivalence of the encoded calendar object to determine ETag equivalence).

        <vspace blankLines="1" />

        Normalization of JSCalendar objects is hindered because of the following reasons:

        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Custom JSCalendar properties may contain arbitrary JSON values, including arrays. However, equivalence of arrays might or might not depend on the order of elements, depending on the respective property definition.</t>
          <t>Several JSCalendar property values are defined as URIs and MIME types, but normalization of these types is inherently protocol and scheme-specific, depending on the use-case of the equivalence definition (see Section 6 of <xref target="RFC3986" />).</t>
        </list>

        Considering this, the definition of equivalence and normalization is left to client and server implementations and to be negotiated by a calendar exchange protocol or defined by another RFC.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="custom-properties" title="Vendor-specific Property Extensions and Values">
        <t>Vendors MAY add additional properties to the calendar object to support their custom features. The names of these properties MUST be prefixed with a domain name controlled by the vendor to avoid conflict, e.g. <spanx style="verb">example.com/customprop</spanx>.</t>

        <t>Some JSCalendar properties allow vendor-specific value extensions. If so, vendor specific values MUST be prefixed with a domain name controlled by the vendor, e.g. <spanx style="verb">example.com/customrel</spanx>.</t>

        <t>Vendors are strongly encouraged to register any new property values or extensions that are useful to other systems as well, rather than use a vendor-specific prefix.</t>

          <t>A globally unique identifier, used to associate the object as the same across different systems, calendars and views. The value of this property MUST be unique across all JSCalendar objects, even if they are of different type. <xref target="RFC4122" /> describes a range of established algorithms to generate universally unique identifiers (UUID), and the random or pseudo-random version is recommended.</t>

          <t>For compatibility with <xref target="RFC5545" /> UIDs, implementations MUST be able to receive and persist values of at least 255 octets for this property, but they MUST NOT truncate values in the middle of a UTF-8 multi-octet sequence.</t>

          <section anchor="recurrence-semantics" title="Interpreting recurrence rules">
            <t>A recurrence rule specifies a set of date-times for recurring calendar objects. A recurrence rule has the following semantics. Note, wherever "year", "month" or "day of month" is used, this is within the calendar system given by the "rscale" property, which defaults to gregorian if omitted.

            <list style="numbers">
              <t>A set of candidates is generated. This is every second within a period defined by the frequency property value:

              <list style="symbols">
                <t><spanx style="verb">yearly</spanx>: every second from midnight on the 1st day of a year (inclusive) to midnight the 1st day of the following year (exclusive).
                <vspace blankLines="1" />
                If skip is not "omit", the calendar system has leap months and there is a byMonth property, generate candidates for the leap months even if they don't occur in this year.
                <vspace blankLines="1" />
                If skip is not "omit" and there is a byMonthDay property, presume each month has the maximum number of days any month may have in this calendar system when generating candidates, even if it's more than this month actually has.</t>

                <t><spanx style="verb">monthly</spanx>: every second from midnight on the 1st day of a month (inclusive) to midnight on the 1st of the following month (exclusive).
                <vspace blankLines="1" />
                If skip is not "omit" and there is a byMonthDay property, presume the month has the maximum number of days any month may have in this calendar system when generating candidates, even if it's more than this month actually has.</t>

                <t><spanx style="verb">weekly</spanx>: every second from midnight (inclusive) on the first day of the week (as defined by the firstDayOfWeek property, or Monday if omitted), to midnight 7 days later (exclusive).</t>

                <t><spanx style="verb">daily</spanx>: every second from midnight at the start of the day (inclusive) to midnight at the end of the day (exclusive).</t>

                <t><spanx style="verb">hourly</spanx>: every second from the beginning of the hour (inclusive) to the beginning of the next hour (exclusive).</t>

                <t><spanx style="verb">minutely</spanx>: every second from the beginning of the minute (inclusive) to the beginning of the next minute (exclusive).</t>

                <t><spanx style="verb">secondly</spanx>: the second itself, only.</t>
              </list></t>

              <t>Each date-time candidate is compared against all of the byX properties of the rule except bySetPosition. If any property in the rule does not match the date-time, it is eliminated. Each byX property is an array; the date-time matches the property if it matches any of the values in the array. The properties have the following semantics:

              <list style="symbols">
                <t>byMonth: the date-time is in the given month.</t>

                <t>byWeekNo: the date-time is in the nth week of the year. Negative numbers mean the nth last week of the year. This corresponds to weeks according to week numbering as defined in ISO.8601.2004, with a week defined as a seven day period, starting on the firstDayOfWeek property value or Monday if omitted. Week number one of the calendar year is the first week that contains at least four days in that calendar year.
                <vspace blankLines="1" />
                If the date-time is not valid (this may happen when generating candidates with a skip property in effect), it is always eliminated by this property.</t>

                <t>byYearDay: the date-time is on the nth day of year. Negative numbers mean the nth last day of the year.
                <vspace blankLines="1" />
                If the date-time is not valid (this may happen when generating candidates with a skip property in effect), it is always eliminated by this property.</t>

                <t>byMonthDay: the date-time is on the given day of the month. Negative numbers mean the nth last day of the month.</t>

                <t>byDay: the date-time is on the given day of the week. If the day is prefixed by a number, it is the nth occurrence of that day of the week within the month (if frequency is monthly) or year (if frequency is yearly). Negative numbers means nth last occurrence within that period.</t>

                <t>byHour: the date-time has the given hour value.</t>

                <t>byMinute: the date-time has the given minute value.</t>

                <t>bySecond: the date-time has the given second value.</t>
              </list>

              If a skip property is defined and is not "omit", there may be candidates that do not correspond to valid dates (e.g. 31st February in the gregorian calendar). In this case, the properties MUST be considered in the order above and:

              <list style="numbers">
                <t>After applying the byMonth filter, if the candidate's month is invalid for the given year increment it (if skip is "forward") or decrement it (if skip is "backward") until a valid month is found, incrementing/decrementing the year as well if you pass through the  beginning/end of the year. This only applies to calendar systems with leap months.</t>
                <t>After applying the byMonthDay filter, if the day of the month is invalid for the given month and year, change the date to the first day of the next month (if skip == "forward") or the last day of the current month (if skip == "backward").</t>
                <t>If any valid date produced after applying the skip is already a candidate, eliminate the duplicate. (For example after adjusting, 30th February and 31st February would both become the same "real" date, so one is eliminated as a duplicate.)</t>
              </list>
            </t>
              <t>If a bySetPosition property is included, this is now applied to the ordered list of remaining dates. This property specifies the indexes of date-times to keep; all others should be eliminated. Negative numbers are indexes from the end of the list, with -1 being the last item.</t>

              <t>Any date-times before the start date of the event are eliminated (see below for why this might be needed).</t>

              <t>If a skip property is included and is not "omit", eliminate any date-times that have already been produced by previous iterations of the algorithm. (This is not possible if skip == "omit".)</t>

              <t>If further dates are required (we have not reached the until date, or count limit) skip the next (interval - 1) sets of candidates, then continue from step 1.</t>
            </list>

            When determining the set of occurrence dates for an event or task, the following extra rules must be applied:

            <list style="numbers">
              <t>The initial date-time to which the rule is applied (the <spanx style="verb">start</spanx> date-time for events; the <spanx style="verb">start</spanx> or <spanx style="verb">due</spanx> date-time for tasks) is always the first occurrence in the expansion (and is counted if the recurrence is limited by a "count" property), even if it would normally not match the rule.</t>

              <t>The first set of candidates to consider is that which would contain the initial date-time. This means the first set may include candidates before the initial date-time; such candidates are eliminated from the results in step (4) as outlined before.</t>

              <t>The following properties MUST be implicitly added to the rule under the given conditions:

              <list style="symbols">
                <t>If frequency is not <spanx style="verb">secondly</spanx> and no bySecond property: Add a bySecond property with the sole value being the seconds value of the initial date-time.</t>

                <t>If frequency is not <spanx style="verb">secondly</spanx> or <spanx style="verb">minutely</spanx>, and no byMinute property: Add a byMinute property with the sole value being the minutes value of the initial date-time.</t>

                <t>If frequency is not <spanx style="verb">secondly</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">minutely</spanx> or <spanx style="verb">hourly</spanx> and no byHour property: Add a byHour property with the sole value being the hours value of the initial date-time.</t>

                <t>If frequency is <spanx style="verb">weekly</spanx> and no byDay property: Add a byDay property with the sole value being the day-of-the-week of the initial date-time.</t>

                <t>If frequency is <spanx style="verb">monthly</spanx> and no byDay property and no byMonthDay property: Add a byMonthDay property with the sole value being the day-of-the-month of the initial date-time.</t>

                <t>If frequency is <spanx style="verb">yearly</spanx> and no byYearDay property:

                <list style="symbols">
                  <t>If there are no byMonth or byWeekNo properties, and either there is a byMonthDay property or there is no byDay property: Add a byMonth property with the sole value being the month of the initial date-time.</t>

                  <t>If there is no byMonthDay, byWeekNo or byDay properties: Add a byMonthDay property with the sole value being the day-of-the-month of the initial date-time.</t>

          <t>If the recurrence id does not match a date-time from the recurrence rule (or no rule is specified), it is to be treated as an additional occurrence (like an RDATE from iCalendar). The patch object may often be empty in this case.</t>

          <t>By default, an occurrence inherits all properties from the main object except the start (or due) date-time, which is shifted to match the recurrence id LocalDateTime. However, individual properties of the occurrence can be modified by a patch, or multiple patches. It is valid to patch the <spanx style="verb">start</spanx> property value, and this patch takes precedence over the value generated from the recurrence id.

            <t>trigger: <spanx style="verb">OffsetTrigger|AbsoluteTrigger|UnknownTrigger</spanx>
            <vspace blankLines="1" />
            Defines when to trigger the alert. New types may be defined in future RFCs.
            <vspace blankLines="1" />
            An <spanx style="strong">OffsetTrigger</spanx> object has the following properties:

              <t>@type: <spanx style="verb">String</spanx> (mandatory)
              <vspace blankLines="1" />

              <t>offset: <spanx style="verb">SignedDuration</spanx> (mandatory).
              <vspace blankLines="1" />
              Defines the offset at which to trigger the alert relative to the time property defined in the <spanx style="verb">relativeTo</spanx> property of the alert. If the calendar object does not define a time zone, the user's default time zone SHOULD be used when determining the offset, if known. Otherwise, the time zone to use is implementation specific.</t>

              <t>relativeTo: <spanx style="verb">String</spanx> (optional, default: <spanx style="verb">start</spanx>)
              <vspace blankLines="1" />

              <list style="symbols">
                <t><spanx style="verb">start</spanx>: triggers the alert relative to the start of the calendar object</t>

            An <spanx style="strong">UnknownTrigger</spanx> object is an object that contains a <spanx style="strong">@type</spanx> property whose value is not recognized (i.e., not <spanx style="verb">OffsetTrigger</spanx> or <spanx style="verb">AbsoluteTrigger</spanx>), plus zero or more other properties.

            <t>acknowledged: <spanx style="verb">UTCDateTime</spanx> (optional)
            <vspace blankLines="1" />
            This records when an alert was last acknowledged. This is set when the user has dismissed the alert; other clients that sync this property SHOULD automatically dismiss or suppress duplicate alerts (alerts with the same alert id that triggered on or before this date-time).
            <vspace blankLines="1" />
            For a recurring calendar object, the <spanx style="verb">acknowledged</spanx> property of the parent object MUST be updated, unless the alert is already overridden in the <spanx style="verb">recurrenceOverrides</spanx> property.
            <vspace blankLines="1" />
            Certain kinds of alert action may not provide feedback as to when the user sees them, for example email based alerts. For those kinds of alerts, this property SHOULD be set immediately when the alert is triggered and the action successfully carried out.</t>

            <t>relatedTo: <spanx style="verb">String[Relation]</spanx> (optional)
            <vspace blankLines="1" />
            Relates this alert to other alerts in the same JSCalendar object. If the user wishes to snooze an alert, the application SHOULD create an alert to trigger after snoozing. All snooze alerts SHOULD set a relation to the identifier of the original alert. The Relation object SHOULD set the <spanx style="verb">parent</spanx> relation type, but MAY be empty.</t>

            <t>action: <spanx style="verb">String</spanx> (optional, default: <spanx style="verb">display</spanx>)
            <vspace blankLines="1" />

            <vspace blankLines="1" />
            The value MUST  be at most one of the following values, an IANA-registered value, or a vendor-specific value:

            <list style="symbols">
              <t><spanx style="verb">display</spanx>: The alert should be displayed as appropriate for the current device and user context.</t>

              <t><spanx style="verb">email</spanx>: The alert should trigger an email sent out to the user, notifying about the alert. This action is typically only appropriate for server implementations.</t>

    <section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Calendaring and scheduling information is very privacy-sensitive. The transmission of such information must be careful to protect it from possible threats, such as eavesdropping, replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, and man-in-the-middle attacks. This document just defines the data format; such considerations are primarily the concern of the API or method of storage and transmission of such files.</t>

      <section anchor="sec-recurrences" title="Expanding Recurrences">
        <t>A recurrence rule may produce infinite occurrences of an event. Implementations MUST handle expansions carefully to prevent accidental or deliberate resource exhaustion.</t>
        <t>Conversely, a recurrence rule may be specified that does not expand to anything. It is not always possible to tell this through static analysis of the rule, so implementations MUST be careful to avoid getting stuck in an infinite loop, or otherwise exhausting resources, searching for the next occurrence.</t>

      <section anchor="json-parsing" title="JSON Parsing">
        <t>The Security Considerations of <xref target="RFC8259"/> apply to the use of JSON as the data interchange format.
        </t>

        <t>As for any serialization format, parsers need to thoroughly check the syntax of the supplied data. JSON uses opening and closing tags for several types and structures, and it is possible that the end of the supplied data will be reached when scanning for a matching closing tag; this is an error condition, and implementations need to stop scanning at the end of the supplied data.</t>

        <t>JSON also uses a string encoding with some escape sequences to encode special characters within a string. Care is needed when processing these escape sequences to ensure that they are fully formed before the special processing is triggered, with special care taken when the escape sequences appear adjacent to other (non-escaped) special characters or adjacent to the end of data (as in the previous paragraph).</t>

        <t>If parsing JSON into a non-textual structured data format, implementations may need to allocate storage to hold JSON string elements.  Since JSON does not use explicit string lengths, the risk of denial of service due to resource exhaustion is small, but implementations may still wish to place limits on the size of allocations they are willing to make in any given context, to avoid untrusted data causing excessive memory allocation.</t>

<section anchor="iana-property-registry" title='Creation of "JSCalendar Properties" Registry'>
  <t>IANA will create the "JSCalendar Properties" registry to allow interoperability of extensions to JSCalendar objects.</t>

  <t>This registry follows the expert review process unless the &quot;intended use&quot; field is <spanx style="verb">common</spanx>, in which case registration follows the specification required process. Preliminary community review for this registry is optional but strongly encouraged.</t>

  <t>A registration can have an intended use of <spanx style="verb">common</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">reserved</spanx>, or <spanx style="verb">obsolete</spanx>. IANA will list common-use registrations prominently and separately from those with other intended use values.</t>

  <t>A <spanx style="verb">reserved</spanx> registration reserves a property name without assigning semantics to avoid name collisions with future extensions or protocol use.</t>

  <t>An <spanx style="verb">obsolete</spanx> registration denotes a property that is no longer expected to be added by up-to-date systems. A new property has probably been defined covering the obsolete property's semantics.</t>

  <t>The JSCalendar property registration procedure is not a formal standards process but rather an administrative procedure intended to allow community comment and sanity checking without excessive time delay.</t>

  <section anchor="iana-property-registry-preliminary-community-review" title="Preliminary Community Review">
    <t>Notice of a potential new registration SHOULD be sent to the Calext mailing list &lt;calsify@ietf.org&gt; for review. This mailing list is appropriate to solicit community feedback on a proposed new property.</t>

    <t>Properties registrations must be marked with their intended use: "common", "reserved" or "obsolete".</t>

    <t>The intent of the public posting to this list is to solicit comments and feedback on the choice of the property name, the unambiguity of the specification document, and a review of any interoperability or security considerations. The submitter may submit a revised registration proposal or abandon the registration completely at any time.</t>
  </section>

  <section anchor="iana-property-registry-submit-request-to-iana" title="Submit Request to IANA">
    <t>Registration requests can be sent to &lt;iana@iana.org&gt;.</t>
  </section>

  <section anchor="iana-property-registry-designated-expert-review" title="Designated Expert Review">
    <t>The primary concern of the designated expert (DE) is preventing name collisions and encouraging the submitter to document security and privacy considerations; a published specification is not required. For a common-use registration, the DE is expected to confirm that suitable documentation, as described in Section 4.6 of <xref target="RFC8126"/>, is available. The DE should also verify that the property name does not conflict with work that is active or already published within the IETF.</t>

    <t>Before a period of 30 days has passed, the DE will either approve or deny the registration request and publish a notice of the decision to the Calext WG mailing list or its successor, as well as inform IANA. A denial notice must be justified by an explanation, and, in the cases where it is possible, concrete suggestions on how the request can be modified so as to become acceptable should be provided.</t>

    <t>If the DE does not respond within 30 days, the registrant may request the IESG take action to process the request in a timely manner.</t>
  </section>

  <section anchor="iana-property-registry-change-procedures" title="Change Procedures">
    <t>Once a JSCalendar property has been published by the IANA, the change controller may request a change to its definition. The same procedure that would be appropriate for the original registration request is used to process a change request.</t>

    <t>JSCalendar property registrations may not be deleted; properties that are no longer believed appropriate for use can be declared obsolete by a change to their &quot;intended use&quot; field; such properties will be clearly marked in the lists published by the IANA.</t>

    <t>Significant changes to a JSCalendar property's definition should be requested only when there are serious omissions or errors in the published specification, as such changes may cause interoperability issues. When review is required, a change request may be denied if it renders entities that were valid under the previous definition invalid under the new definition.</t>

    <t>The owner of a JSCalendar property may pass responsibility to another person or agency by informing the IANA; this can be done without discussion or review.</t>

    <t>The IESG may reassign responsibility for a JSCalendar property. The most common case of this will be to enable changes to be made to a registration where the author of the registration has died, moved out of contact, or is otherwise unable to make changes that are important to the community.</t>
