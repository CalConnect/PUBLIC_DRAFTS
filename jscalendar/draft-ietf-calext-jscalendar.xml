      <t>This specification defines a data model and JSON representation of calendar data that can be used for storage and data exchange in a calendaring and scheduling environment. It aims to be an alternative to the widely deployed iCalendar data format and to be unambiguous, extendable and simple to process. In contrast to the JSON-based jCal format, it is not a direct mapping from iCalendar and expands semantics where appropriate.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>This document defines a data model for calendar event and task objects, or groups of such objects, in electronic calendar applications and systems. It aims to be unambiguous, extendable and simple to process.</t>

      <t>The key design considerations for this data model are as follows:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>The attributes of the calendar entry represented must be described as a simple key-value pair, reducing complexity of its representation.</t>
          <t>The data model should avoid all ambiguities and make it difficult to make mistakes during implementation.</t>
          <t>Most of the initial set of attributes should be taken from the iCalendar data format <xref target="RFC5545" /> and <xref target="RFC7986" /> and extensions, but the specification should add new attributes or value types, or not support existing ones, where appropriate. Conversion between the data formats need not fully preserve semantic meaning.</t>
          <t>Extensions, such as new properties and components, MUST NOT lead to requiring an update to this document.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>The representation of this data model is defined in the I-JSON format <xref target="RFC7493" />, which is a strict subset of the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format <xref target="RFC8259" />. Using JSON is mostly a pragmatic choice: its widespread use makes JSCalendar easier to adopt, and the ready availability of production-ready JSON implementations eliminates a whole category of parser-related interoperability issues.</t>

      <section anchor="relation-to-icalendar" title="Relation to the iCalendar format">
        <t>The iCalendar data format <xref target="RFC5545" />, a widely deployed interchange format for calendaring and scheduling data, has served calendaring vendors for a long while, but contains some ambiguities and pitfalls that can not be overcome without backward-incompatible changes.</t>

        <t>For example, iCalendar defines various formats for local times, UTC time and dates, which confuses new users. Other sources for errors are the requirement for custom time zone definitions within a single calendar component, as well as the iCalendar format itself; the latter causing interoperability issues due to misuse of CR LF terminated strings, line continuations and subtle differences between iCalendar parsers. Lastly, up until recently the iCalendar format did not have a way to express a concise difference between two calendar components, which results in verbose exchanges during scheduling.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="relation-to-jcal" title="Relation to the jCal format">
        <t>The JSON format for iCalendar data, <xref target="RFC7265">jCal</xref>, is a direct mapping between iCalendar and JSON. It does not attempt to extend or update iCalendar semantics, and consequently does not address the issues outlined in <xref target="relation-to-icalendar" />.</t>

        <t>Since the standardization of jCal, the majority of implementations and service providers either kept using iCalendar, or came up with their own proprietary JSON representation, which often are incompatible with each other. JSCalendar is intended to meet this demand for JSON formatted calendar data, and to provide a standard representation as an alternative to new proprietary formats.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="notational-conventions" title="Notational Conventions">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119" />.</t>

        <t>The underlying format used for this specification is JSON. Consequently, the terms "object" and "array" as well as the four primitive types (strings, numbers, booleans, and null) are to be interpreted as described in Section 1 of <xref target="RFC8259" />.</t>

        <t>Some examples in this document contain "partial" JSON documents used for illustrative purposes. In these examples, three periods "..." are used to indicate a portion of the document that has been removed for compactness.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="type-signatures" title="Type signatures">
        <t>Type signatures are given for all JSON values in this document. The following conventions are used:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
          <t><spanx style="verb">*</spanx> - The type is undefined (the value could be any type, although permitted values may be constrained by the context of this value).</t>
          <t><spanx style="verb">String</spanx> - The JSON string type.</t>
          <t><spanx style="verb">Number</spanx> - The JSON number type.</t>
          <t><spanx style="verb">Boolean</spanx> - The JSON boolean type.</t>
          <t><spanx style="verb">A[B]</spanx> - A JSON object where the keys are all of type <spanx style="verb">A</spanx>, and the values are all of type <spanx style="verb">B</spanx>.</t>
          <t><spanx style="verb">A[]</spanx> - An array of values of type
            <spanx style="verb">A</spanx>.</t>
          <t><spanx style="verb">A|B</spanx> - The value is either of type
            <spanx style="verb">A</spanx> or of type
            <spanx style="verb">B</spanx>.</t>
        </list></t>

        <t>Other types may also be given, with their representation defined elsewhere in this document.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="data-types" title="Data Types">
        <t>In addition to the standard JSON data types, the following data types are used in this specification:</t>

        <section anchor="int-and-unsignedint" title="Int and UnsignedInt">
          <t>Where <spanx style="verb">Int</spanx> is given as a data type, it means an integer in the range -2^53+1 &lt;= value &lt;= 2^53-1, the safe range for integers stored in a floating-point double, represented as a JSON <spanx style="verb">Number</spanx>.</t>

          <t>Where <spanx style="verb">UnsignedInt</spanx> is given as a data type, it means an <spanx style="verb">Int</spanx> where the value MUST be in the range 0 &lt;= value &lt;= 2^53-1.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="utcdate-type" title="UTCDateTime">
          <t>This is a string in <xref target="RFC3339" /> <spanx style="verb">date-time</spanx> format, with the further restrictions that any letters MUST be in uppercase, the time component MUST be included and the time offset MUST be the character <spanx style="verb">Z</spanx>. Fractional second values MUST NOT be included unless non-zero and MUST NOT have trailing zeros, to ensure there is only a single representation for each date-time. </t>

          <t>For example <spanx style="verb">2010-10-10T10:10:10.003Z</spanx> is OK, but <spanx style="verb">2010-10-10T10:10:10.000Z</spanx> is invalid and MUST be encoded as <spanx style="verb">2010-10-10T10:10:10Z</spanx>.</t>

          <t>In common notation, it should be of the form <spanx style="verb">YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ</spanx>.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="localdate-type" title="LocalDateTime">
          <t>This is a date-time string with no time zone/offset information. It is otherwise in the same format as UTCDateTime, including fractional seconds. For example <spanx style="verb">2006-01-02T15:04:05</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">2006-01-02T15:04:05.003</spanx> are both valid. The time zone to associate the LocalDateTime with comes from an associated property, or if no time zone is associated it defines <spanx style="strong">floating time</spanx>. Floating date-times are not tied to any specific time zone. Instead, they occur in every time zone at the same wall-clock time (as opposed to the same instant point in time).</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="duration-type" title="Duration">
          <t>Where Duration is given as a type, it means a length of time represented by a subset of ISO8601 duration format, as specified by the following ABNF:</t>

          <figure>
            <artwork><![CDATA[    dur-secfrac = "." 1*DIGIT
    dur-second  = 1*DIGIT [dur-secfrac] "S"
    dur-minute  = 1*DIGIT "M" [dur-second]
    dur-hour    = 1*DIGIT "H" [dur-minute]
    dur-time    = "T" (dur-hour / dur-minute / dur-second)
    dur-day     = 1*DIGIT "D"
    dur-week    = 1*DIGIT "W"

    duration    = "P" (dur-day [dur-time] / dur-time / dur-week)]]></artwork>
          </figure>

          <t>In addition, the duration MUST NOT include fractional second values unless the fraction is non-zero.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="signed-duration-type" title="SignedDuration">
          <t>A SignedDuration represents a length of time that may be positive or negative and is typically used to express the offset of a point in time relative to an associated time. It is represented as a Duration, optionally preceded by a sign character. It is specified by the following ABNF:</t>

          <figure>
            <artwork><![CDATA[    signed-duration = (["+"] / "-") duration]]></artwork>
          </figure>

          <t>A negative sign indicates a point in time at or before the associated time, a positive or no sign a time at or after the associated time.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="the-id-data-type" title="Id">
          <t>Where <spanx style="verb">Id</spanx> is given as a data type, it means a <spanx style="verb">String</spanx> of at least 1 and a maximum of 255 octets in size, and it MUST only contain characters from the "URL and Filename Safe" base64 alphabet, as defined in Section 5 of <xref target="RFC4648" />, excluding the pad character (<spanx style="verb">=</spanx>). This means the allowed characters are the ASCII alphanumeric characters (<spanx style="verb">A-Za-z0-9</spanx>), hyphen (<spanx style="verb">-</spanx>), and underscore (<spanx style="verb">_</spanx>).</t>

          <t>Unless otherwise specified, Ids are arbitrary and only have meaning within the object where they are being used. Ids need not be unique between different objects. For example, two JSEvent objects MAY use the same ids in their respective <spanx style="verb">links</spanx> properties. Or within the same JSEvent object the same Id could appear in the <spanx style="verb">participants</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">alerts</spanx> properties. This does not imply any semantic connection between the two. <vspace blankLines="1" /> Nevertheless, a UUID is typically a good choice.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="patchobject-type" title="PatchObject">
          <t>A PatchObject is of type <spanx style="verb">String[*]</spanx>, and represents an unordered set of patches on a JSON object. The keys are a path in a subset of <xref target="RFC6901" /> JSON pointer format, with an implicit leading <spanx style="verb">/</spanx> (i.e. prefix each key with <spanx style="verb">/</spanx> before applying the JSON pointer evaluation algorithm).</t>

          <t>A patch within a PatchObject is only valid if all of the following conditions apply:</t>

          <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>The pointer MUST NOT reference inside an array (i.e. it MUST NOT insert/delete from an array; the array MUST be replaced in its entirety instead).</t>
            <t>When evaluating a path, all parts prior to the last (i.e. the value after the final slash) MUST exist.</t>
            <t>There MUST NOT be two patches in the PatchObject where the pointer of one is the prefix of the pointer of the other, e.g. <spanx style="verb">alerts/foo/offset</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">alerts</spanx>.</t>
          </list></t>

          <t>The value associated with each pointer is either:
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>null: Remove the property from the patched object. If not present in the parent, this a no-op.</t>
              <t>Anything else: The value to set for this property (this may be a replacement or addition to the object being patched).</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>Implementations MUST reject a PatchObject if any of its patches are invalid.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="timezones" title="Time Zones">
          <t>By default, time zones in JSCalendar are identified by their name in the <eref target="https://www.iana.org/time-zones">IANA Time Zone Database</eref>, and the zone rules of the respective zone record apply.</t>

          <t>Implementations MAY embed the definition of custom time zones in the <spanx style="verb">timeZones</spanx> property (see <xref target="timezones-prop" />).</t>
        </section>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="jscalendar-objects" title="JSCalendar objects">
      <t>This section describes the calendar object types specified by JSCalendar.</t>

      <section anchor="jsevent" title="JSEvent">
        <t>MIME type: <spanx style="verb">application/jscalendar+json;type=jsevent</spanx></t>

        <t>A JSEvent represents a scheduled amount of time on a calendar, typically a meeting, appointment, reminder or anniversary. Multiple participants may partake in the event at multiple locations.</t>

        <t>The <xref target="type">@type</xref> property value MUST be <spanx style="verb">jsevent</spanx>.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="jstask" title="JSTask">
        <t>MIME type: <spanx style="verb">application/jscalendar+json;type=jstask</spanx></t>

        <t>A JSTask represents an action-item, assignment, to-do or work item.</t>

        <t>The <xref target="type">@type</xref> property value MUST be <spanx style="verb">jstask</spanx>.</t>

        <t>A JSTask may start and be due at certain points in time, may take some estimated time to complete and may recur; none of which is required. This notably differs from <xref target="jsevent">JSEvent</xref> which is required to start at a certain point in time and typically takes some non-zero duration to complete.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="jsgroup" title="JSGroup">
        <t>MIME type: <spanx style="verb">application/jscalendar+json;type=jsgroup</spanx></t>

        <t>A JSGroup is a collection of <xref target="jsevent">JSEvent</xref> and/or <xref target="jstask">JSTask</xref> objects. Typically, objects are grouped by topic (e.g. by keywords) or calendar membership.</t>

        <t>The <xref target="type">@type</xref> property value MUST be <spanx style="verb">jsgroup</spanx>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="structure-of-jscalendar-objects" title="Structure of JSCalendar objects">
      <t>A JSCalendar object is a JSON object, which MUST be valid I-JSON (a stricter subset of JSON), as specified in <xref target="RFC8259" />. Property names and values are case-sensitive.</t>

      <t>The object has a collection of properties, as specified in the following sections. Properties are specified as being either mandatory or optional. Optional properties may have a default value, if explicitly specified in the property definition.</t>

      <section anchor="normalization" title="Normalization and equivalence">
        <t>JSCalendar aims to provide unambiguous definitions for value types and properties, but does not define a general normalization or equivalence method for JSCalendar objects and types. This is because the notion of equivalence might range from byte-level equivalence to semantic equivalence, depending on the respective use case (for example, the CalDAV protocol <xref target="RFC4791" /> requires octet equivalence of the encoded calendar object to determine ETag equivalence).

        <vspace blankLines="1" />

        Normalization of JSCalendar objects is hindered because of the following reasons:

        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Custom JSCalendar properties may contain arbitrary JSON values, including arrays. However, equivalence of arrays might or might not depend on the order of elements, depending on the respective property definition.</t>
          <t>Several JSCalendar property values are defined as URIs and MIME types, but normalization of these types is inherently protocol and scheme-specific, depending on the use-case of the equivalence definition (see Section 6 of <xref target="RFC3986" />).</t>
        </list>

        Considering this, the definition of equivalence and normalization is left to client and server implementations and to be negotiated by a calendar exchange protocol or defined by another RFC.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="custom-properties" title="Custom property extensions and values">
        <t>Vendors MAY add additional properties to the calendar object to support their custom features. The names of these properties MUST be prefixed with a domain name controlled by the vendor to avoid conflict, e.g. <spanx style="verb">example.com/customprop</spanx>.</t>

        <t>Some JSCalendar properties allow vendor-specific value extensions. If so, vendor specific values MUST be prefixed with a domain name controlled by the vendor, e.g. <spanx style="verb">example.com/customrel</spanx>, unless otherwise noted.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="jscalendar-props" title="Common JSCalendar properties">
      <t>This section describes the properties that are common to the various JSCalendar object types. Specific JSCalendar object types may only support a subset of these properties. The object type definitions in <xref target="jscalendar-object-props" /> describe the set of supported properties per type.</t>

      <section anchor="metadata-properties" title="Metadata properties">
        <section anchor="type" title="@type">
          <t>Type: <spanx style="verb">String</spanx> (mandatory).</t>
          <t>Specifies the type which this object represents. This MUST be one of the following values, registered in a future RFC, or a vendor-specific value:
            <list style="symbols">
              <t><spanx style="verb">jsevent</spanx>: a JSCalendar event (<xref target="jsevent" />).</t>
              <t><spanx style="verb">jstask</spanx>: a JSCalendar task (<xref target="jstask" />).</t>
              <t><spanx style="verb">jsgroup</spanx>: a JSCalendar group (<xref target="jsgroup" />).</t>
            </list>
          </t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="uid" title="uid">
          <t>Type: <spanx style="verb">String</spanx> (mandatory).</t>
          <t>A globally unique identifier, used to associate the object as the same across different systems, calendars and views. The value of this property MUST be unique across all JSCalendar objects, even if they are of different type. <xref target="RFC4122" /> describes a range of established algorithms to generate universally unique identifiers (UUID), and the random or pseudo-random version is recommended.</t>

          <t>For compatibility with <xref target="RFC5545" /> UIDs, implementations MUST be able to receive and persist values of at least 255 octets for this property, but they MUST NOT truncate values in the middle of a UTF-8 multi-octet sequence.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="relatedTo" title="relatedTo">
          <t>Type: <spanx style="verb">String[Relation]</spanx> (optional).</t>

          <t>Relates the object to other JSCalendar objects. This is represented as a map of the UIDs of the related objects to information about the relation.</t>

          <t>A Relation object has the following property:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>relation: <spanx style="verb">String[Boolean]</spanx> (optional)

            <vspace blankLines="1" />

            Describes how the linked object is related to this object as a set of relation types. If specified, the set MUST NOT be empty. If ommitted, the relationship between the two objects is unspecified.

            <vspace blankLines="1" />

            Keys in the set MUST be one of the following values, defined in a future specification or a vendor-specific value:

            <list style="symbols">
              <t><spanx style="verb">first</spanx>: The linked object is the first in the series this object is part of.</t>
              <t><spanx style="verb">next</spanx>: The linked object is the next in the series this object is part of.</t>
              <t><spanx style="verb">child</spanx>: The linked object is a subpart of this object.</t>
              <t><spanx style="verb">parent</spanx>: This object is part of the overall linked object.</t>
            </list>

            The value for each key in the set MUST be true.</t>
          </list></t>

          <t>Note, the Relation object only has one property; it is specified as an object with a single property rather than mapping directly from the UID to relation types to allow for extension in the future.</t>

          <t>If an object is split to make a "this and future" change to a recurrence, the original object MUST be truncated to end at the previous occurrence before this split, and a new object created to represent all the objects after the split. A <spanx style="verb">next</spanx> relation MUST be set on the original object's relatedTo property for the UID of the new object. A <spanx style="verb">first</spanx> relation for the UID of the first object in the series MUST be set on the new object. Clients can then follow these UIDs to get the complete set of objects if the user wishes to modify them all at once.</t>

        <section anchor="prodId" title="prodId">
          <t>Type: <spanx style="verb">String</spanx> (optional).</t>

          <t>The identifier for the product that created the JSCalendar object.</t>

          <t>The vendor of the implementation SHOULD ensure that this is a globally unique identifier, using some technique such as an FPI value, as defined in [ISO.9070.1991]. It MUST only use characters of an iCalendar TEXT data value (see Section 3.3.11 in <xref target="RFC5545" />).</t>

          <t>This property SHOULD NOT be used to alter the interpretation of an JSCalendar object beyond the semantics specified in this document. For example, it is not to be used to further the understanding of non-standard properties.</t>

          <section anchor="recurrence-semantics" title="Interpreting recurrence rules">
            <t>A recurrence rule specifies a set of date-times for recurring calendar objects. A recurrence rule has the following semantics. Note, wherever "year", "month" or "day of month" is used, this is within the calendar system given by the "rscale" property, which defaults to gregorian if omitted.

            <list style="numbers">
              <t>A set of candidates is generated. This is every second within a period defined by the frequency property value:

              <list style="symbols">
                <t><spanx style="verb">yearly</spanx>: every second from midnight on the 1st day of a year (inclusive) to midnight the 1st day of the following year (exclusive).
                <vspace blankLines="1" />
                If skip is not "omit", the calendar system has leap months and there is a byMonth property, generate candidates for the leap months even if they don't occur in this year.
                <vspace blankLines="1" />
                If skip is not "omit" and there is a byMonthDay property, presume each month has the maximum number of days any month may have in this calendar system when generating candidates, even if it's more than this month actually has.</t>

                <t><spanx style="verb">monthly</spanx>: every second from midnight on the 1st day of a month (inclusive) to midnight on the 1st of the following month (exclusive).
                <vspace blankLines="1" />
                If skip is not "omit" and there is a byMonthDay property, presume the month has the maximum number of days any month may have in this calendar system when generating candidates, even if it's more than this month actually has.</t>

                <t><spanx style="verb">weekly</spanx>: every second from midnight (inclusive) on the first day of the week (as defined by the firstDayOfWeek property, or Monday if omitted), to midnight 7 days later (exclusive).</t>

                <t><spanx style="verb">daily</spanx>: every second from midnight at the start of the day (inclusive) to midnight at the end of the day (exclusive).</t>

                <t><spanx style="verb">hourly</spanx>: every second from the beginning of the hour (inclusive) to the beginning of the next hour (exclusive).</t>

                <t><spanx style="verb">minutely</spanx>: every second from the beginning of the minute (inclusive) to the beginning of the next minute (exclusive).</t>

                <t><spanx style="verb">secondly</spanx>: the second itself, only.</t>
              </list></t>

              <t>Each date-time candidate is compared against all of the byX properties of the rule except bySetPosition. If any property in the rule does not match the date-time, it is eliminated. Each byX property is an array; the date-time matches the property if it matches any of the values in the array. The properties have the following semantics:

              <list style="symbols">
                <t>byMonth: the date-time is in the given month.</t>

                <t>byWeekNo: the date-time is in the nth week of the year. Negative numbers mean the nth last week of the year. This corresponds to weeks according to week numbering as defined in ISO.8601.2004, with a week defined as a seven day period, starting on the firstDayOfWeek property value or Monday if omitted. Week number one of the calendar year is the first week that contains at least four days in that calendar year.
                <vspace blankLines="1" />
                If the date-time is not valid (this may happen when generating candidates with a skip property in effect), it is always eliminated by this property.</t>

                <t>byYearDay: the date-time is on the nth day of year. Negative numbers mean the nth last day of the year.
                <vspace blankLines="1" />
                If the date-time is not valid (this may happen when generating candidates with a skip property in effect), it is always eliminated by this property.</t>

                <t>byMonthDay: the date-time is on the given day of the month. Negative numbers mean the nth last day of the month.</t>

                <t>byDay: the date-time is on the given day of the week. If the day is prefixed by a number, it is the nth occurrence of that day of the week within the month (if frequency is monthly) or year (if frequency is yearly). Negative numbers means nth last occurrence within that period.</t>

                <t>byHour: the date-time has the given hour value.</t>

                <t>byMinute: the date-time has the given minute value.</t>

                <t>bySecond: the date-time has the given second value.</t>
              </list>

              If a skip property is defined and is not "omit", there may be candidates that do not correspond to valid dates (e.g. 31st February in the gregorian calendar). In this case, the properties MUST be considered in the order above and:

              <list style="numbers">
                <t>After applying the byMonth filter, if the candidate's month is invalid for the given year increment it (if skip is "forward") or decrement it (if skip is "backward") until a valid month is found, incrementing/decrementing the year as well if you pass through the  beginning/end of the year. This only applies to calendar systems with leap months.</t>
                <t>After applying the byMonthDay filter, if the day of the month is invalid for the given month and year, change the date to the first day of the next month (if skip == "forward") or the last day of the current month (if skip == "backward").</t>
                <t>If any valid date produced after applying the skip is already a candidate, eliminate the duplicate. (For example after adjusting, 30th February and 31st February would both become the same "real" date, so one is eliminated as a duplicate.)</t>
              </list>
            </t>
              <t>If a bySetPosition property is included, this is now applied to the ordered list of remaining dates. This property specifies the indexes of date-times to keep; all others should be eliminated. Negative numbers are indexes from the end of the list, with -1 being the last item.</t>

              <t>Any date-times before the start date of the event are eliminated (see below for why this might be needed).</t>

              <t>If a skip property is included and is not "omit", eliminate any date-times that have already been produced by previous iterations of the algorithm. (This is not possible if skip == "omit".)</t>

              <t>If further dates are required (we have not reached the until date, or count limit) skip the next (interval - 1) sets of candidates, then continue from step 1.</t>
            </list>

            When determining the set of occurrence dates for an event or task, the following extra rules must be applied:

            <list style="numbers">
              <t>The start date-time is always the first occurrence in the expansion (and is counted if the recurrence is limited by a "count" property), even if it would normally not match the rule.</t>

              <t>The first set of candidates to consider is that which would contain the start date-time. This means the first set may include candidates before the start; such candidates are eliminated from the results in step (4) as outlined before.</t>

              <t>The following properties MUST be implicitly added to the rule under the given conditions:

              <list style="symbols">
                <t>If frequency is not <spanx style="verb">secondly</spanx> and no bySecond property: Add a bySecond property with the sole value being the seconds value of the start date-time.</t>

                <t>If frequency is not <spanx style="verb">secondly</spanx> or <spanx style="verb">minutely</spanx>, and no byMinute property: Add a byMinute property with the sole value being the minutes value of the start date-time.</t>

                <t>If frequency is not <spanx style="verb">secondly</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">minutely</spanx> or <spanx style="verb">hourly</spanx> and no byHour property: Add a byHour property with the sole value being the hours value of the start date-time.</t>

                <t>If frequency is <spanx style="verb">weekly</spanx> and no byDay property: Add a byDay property with the sole value being the day-of-the-week of the start date-time.</t>

                <t>If frequency is <spanx style="verb">monthly</spanx> and no byDay property and no byMonthDay property: Add a byMonthDay property with the sole value being the day-of-the-month of the start date-time.</t>

                <t>If frequency is <spanx style="verb">yearly</spanx> and no byYearDay property:

                <list style="symbols">
                  <t>If there are no byMonth or byWeekNo properties, and either there is a byMonthDay property or there is no byDay property: Add a byMonth property with the sole value being the month of the start date-time.</t>

                  <t>If there is no byMonthDay, byWeekNo or byDay properties: Add a byMonthDay property with the sole value being the day-of-the-month of the start date-time.</t>

          <t>A map of the recurrence ids (the date-time of the start of the occurrence) to an object of patches to apply to the generated occurrence object.</t>

          <t>If the recurrence id does not match an expanded start date from a recurrence rule, it is to be treated as an additional occurrence (like an RDATE from iCalendar). The patch object may often be empty in this case.</t>

          <t>If the patch object defines the <spanx style="verb">excluded</spanx> property value to be true, then the recurring calendar object does not occur at the recurrence id date-time (like an EXDATE from iCalendar). Such a patch object MUST NOT patch any other property.</t>

          <t>By default, an occurrence inherits all properties from the main object except the start (or due) date-time, which is shifted to the new start time of the LocalDateTime key. However, individual properties of the occurrence can be modified by a patch, or multiple patches. It is valid to patch the start property value, and this patch takes precedence over the LocalDateTime key. Both the LocalDateTime key as well as the patched start date-time may occur before the original JSCalendar object's start or due date.</t>

            An <spanx style="strong">OffsetTrigger</spanx> object has the following properties:

              <t>offset: <spanx style="verb">SignedDuration</spanx> (mandatory).
              <vspace blankLines="1" />
              Defines to trigger the alert relative to the time property defined in the <spanx style="verb">relativeTo</spanx> property. If the calendar object does not define a time zone, the user's default time zone SHOULD be used when determining the offset, if known. Otherwise, the time zone to use is implementation specific.</t>

              <t>relativeTo: <spanx style="verb">String</spanx> (optional, default: <spanx style="verb">start</spanx>)
              <vspace blankLines="1" />
              Specifies the time property which the alert offset is relative to. The value MUST be one of:

            An <spanx style="strong">UnknownTrigger</spanx> object is an object that contains a <spanx style="strong">type</spanx> property whose value is not <spanx style="verb">offset</spanx>, plus zero or more other properties.  This is for compatibility with client extensions and future RFCs.  Implementations SHOULD NOT trigger for trigger types they do not understand, but MUST preserve them.</t>

            <t>acknowledged: <spanx style="verb">UTCDateTime</spanx> (optional)
            <vspace blankLines="1" />
            When the user has permanently dismissed the alert the client MUST set this to the current time in UTC. Other clients which sync this property can then automatically dismiss or suppress duplicate alerts (alerts with the same alert id that triggered on or before this date-time).
            <vspace blankLines="1" />
            For a recurring calendar object, the <spanx style="verb">acknowledged</spanx> property of the parent object MUST be updated, unless the alert is already overridden in the <spanx style="verb">recurrenceOverrides</spanx> property.</t>

            <t>snoozed: <spanx style="verb">UTCDateTime</spanx> (optional).
            <vspace blankLines="1" />
            If the user temporarily dismisses the alert, this is the UTC date-time after which it should trigger again. Setting this property on an instance of a recurring calendar object MUST update the alarm on the top-level object, unless the respective instance already is defined in <spanx style="verb">recurrenceOverrides</spanx>. It MUST NOT generate an override for the sole use of snoozing an alarm.</t>

In addition, the <spanx style="verb">locale</spanx> property of the patched object is set to the language tag. All pointers for patches MUST end with one of the following suffixes; any patch that does not follow this MUST be ignored unless otherwise specified in a future RFC:

            <t>description</t>

          For example, a patch to `recurrenceOverrides/2018-01-05T14:00:00/locations/abcd1234/title` is permissible, but a patch to `uid` is not.</t>

          <t>Note that this specification does not define how to maintain validity of localized content. For example, a client application changing a JSCalendar object's title property might also need to update any localizations of this property. Client implementations SHOULD provide the means to manage localizations, but how to achieve this is specific to the application's workflow and requirements.</t>

      <t>The use of JSON as a format does have its own inherent security risks as discussed in Section 12 of <xref target="RFC8259" />. Even though JSON is considered a safe subset of JavaScript, it should be kept in mind that a flaw in the parser processing JSON could still impose a threat, which doesn't arise with conventional iCalendar data.</t>

      <t>With this in mind, a parser for JSON data aware of the security implications should be used for the format described in this document. For example, the use of JavaScript's <spanx style="verb">eval()</spanx> function is considered an unacceptable security risk, as described in Section 12 of <xref target="RFC8259" />. A native parser with full awareness of the JSON format should be preferred.</t>

      <t>Several JSCalendar properties contain URIs as values, and processing these properties requires extra care. Section 7 of <xref target="RFC3986" /> discusses security risk related to URIs.</t>
