    <abstract>
      <t>This specification defines a data model and JSON representation of calendar data that can be used for storage and data exchange in a calendaring and scheduling environment. It aims to be an alternative and, over time, successor to the widely deployed iCalendar data format. It also aims to be unambiguous, extendable, and simple to process. In contrast to the jCal format, which is also based on JSON, JSCalendar is not a direct mapping from iCalendar but defines the data model independently and expands semantics where appropriate.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>This document defines a data model for calendar event and task objects, or groups of such objects, in electronic calendar applications and systems. The format aims to be unambiguous, extendable, and simple to process.</t>
      <t>The key design considerations for this data model are as follows:
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>The attributes of the calendar entry represented must be described as simple key-value pairs. Simple events are simple to represent; complex events can be modeled accurately.</li>
        <li>Wherever possible, there should be only one way to express the desired semantics, reducing complexity.</li>
        <li>The data model should avoid ambiguities, which often lead to interoperability issues between implementations.</li>


        <li>The data model should be generally compatible with the iCalendar data format <xref target="RFC5545" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC7986" format="default"/> and extensions, but the specification should add new attributes where the iCalendar format currently lacks expressivity, and drop seldom-used, obsolete, or redundant properties. This means translation with no loss of semantics should be easy with most common iCalendar files.</li>
        <li>Extensions, such as new properties and components, should not require updates to this document.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>The representation of this data model is defined in the Internet JSON (I-JSON) format <xref target="RFC7493" format="default"/>, which is a strict subset of the JSON data interchange format <xref target="RFC8259" format="default"/>. Using JSON is mostly a pragmatic choice: its widespread use makes JSCalendar easier to adopt and the ready availability of production-ready JSON implementations eliminates a whole category of parser-related interoperability issues, which iCalendar has often suffered from.</t>
      <section anchor="relation-to-icalendar" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Motivation and Relation to iCalendar and jCal</name>
        <t>The iCalendar data format <xref target="RFC5545" format="default"/>, a widely deployed interchange format for calendaring and scheduling data, has served calendaring vendors for a long time but contains some ambiguities and pitfalls that cannot be overcome without backward-incompatible changes.</t>
        <t>Sources of implementation errors include the following:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>iCalendar defines various formats for local times, UTC, and dates.</li>
          <li>iCalendar requires custom time zone definitions within a single calendar component.</li>
          <li>iCalendar's definition of recurrence rules is ambiguous and has resulted in differing interpretations, even between experienced calendar developers.</li>
          <li>The iCalendar format itself causes interoperability issues due to misuse of CRLF-terminated strings, line continuations, and subtle differences among iCalendar parsers.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>In recent years, many new products and services have appeared that wish to use a JSON representation of calendar data within their APIs. The JSON format for iCalendar data, <xref target="RFC7265" format="default">jCal</xref>, is a direct mapping between iCalendar and JSON. In its effort to represent full iCalendar semantics, it inherits all the same pitfalls and uses a complicated JSON structure.</t>
        <t>As a consequence, since the standardization of jCal, the majority of implementations and service providers either kept using iCalendar or came up with their own proprietary JSON representations, which are incompatible with each other and often suffer from common pitfalls, such as storing event start times in UTC (which become incorrect if the time zone's rules change in the future). JSCalendar meets the demand for JSON-formatted calendar data that is free of such known problems and provides a standard representation as an alternative to the proprietary formats.</t>

        <t>The underlying format used for this specification is JSON. Consequently, the terms "object" and "array" as well as the four primitive types (strings, numbers, booleans, and null) are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC8259" sectionFormat="of" section="1" />.</t>

        <dl newline="false">
          <dt><tt>*</tt>:</dt>

        </dl>
        <t>Other types may also be given; their representations are defined elsewhere in this document.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="data-types" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Data Types</name>
        <t>In addition to the standard JSON data types, the following data types are used in this specification:</t>
        <section anchor="type-Id" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Id</name>
          <t>Where <tt>Id</tt> is given as a data type, it means a <tt>String</tt> of at least 1 and a maximum of 255 octets in size, and it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> only contain characters from the "URL and Filename Safe" base64url alphabet, as defined in <xref target="RFC4648" sectionFormat="of" section="5"/>, excluding the pad character (<tt>=</tt>). This means the allowed characters are the ASCII alphanumeric characters (<tt>A-Za-z0-9</tt>), hyphen (<tt>-</tt>), and underscore (<tt>_</tt>).</t>
          <t>In many places in JSCalendar, a JSON map is used where the map keys are of type Id and the map values are all the same type of object. This construction represents an unordered set of objects, with the added advantage that each entry has a name (the corresponding map key). This allows for more concise patching of objects, and, when applicable, for the objects in question to be referenced from other objects within the JSCalendar object.</t>
          <t>Unless otherwise specified for a particular property, there are no uniqueness constraints on an Id value (other than, of course, the requirement that you cannot have two values with the same key within a single JSON map). For example, two Event objects might use the same Ids in their respective <tt>links</tt> properties or, within the same Event object, the same Id could appear in the <tt>participants</tt> and <tt>alerts</tt> properties. These situations do not imply any semantic connections among the objects.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="type-Int" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Int</name>
          <t>Where <tt>Int</tt> is given as a data type, it means an integer in the range -2<sup>53</sup>+1 &lt;= value &lt;= 2<sup>53</sup>-1, the safe range for integers stored in a floating-point double, represented as a JSON <tt>Number</tt>.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="type-UnsignedInt" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>UnsignedInt</name>
          <t>Where <tt>UnsignedInt</tt> is given as a data type, it means an integer in the range 0 &lt;= value &lt;= 2<sup>53</sup>-1, represented as a JSON <tt>Number</tt>.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="type-UTCDateTime" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>UTCDateTime</name>
          <t>This is a string in the <tt>date-time</tt> <xref target="RFC3339" format="default"/> format, with
	    the
	      further restrictions that any letters <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be in uppercase, and the time offset
	        <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be the character <tt>Z</tt>. Fractional second values <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be
		  included unless non-zero and <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> have trailing zeros, to ensure there is only a
		    single representation for each date-time. </t>
          <t>For example, <tt>2010-10-10T10:10:10.003Z</tt> is conformant, but <tt>2010-10-10T10:10:10.000Z</tt>
	    is invalid and is correctly encoded as <tt>2010-10-10T10:10:10Z</tt>.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="type-LocalDateTime" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>LocalDateTime</name>
          <t>This is a date-time string with no time zone/offset information. It is otherwise in the same
	    format as UTCDateTime, including fractional seconds. For example, <tt>2006-01-02T15:04:05</tt> and
	      <tt>2006-01-02T15:04:05.003</tt> are both valid. The time zone to associate with the LocalDateTime
	        comes from the <tt>timeZone</tt> property of the JSCalendar object (see <xref target="prop-timeZone"
		  format="default"/>). If no time zone is specified, the LocalDateTime is <tt>floating</tt>. Floating
		  date-times are not tied to any specific time zone. Instead, they occur in each time zone at the given
		    wall-clock time (as opposed to the same instant point in time).</t>
          <t>A time zone may have a period of discontinuity, for example, a change from standard time to
	    daylight savings time. When converting local date-times that fall in the discontinuity to UTC, the
	      offset before the transition <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be used.</t>
          <t>For example, in the America/Los_Angeles time zone, the date-time 2020-11-01T01:30:00 occurs twice:
	    before the daylight savings time (DST) transition with a UTC offset of -07:00 and again after the
	      transition with an offset of -08:00. When converting to UTC, we therefore use the offset before the
	        transition (-07:00), so it becomes 2020-11-01T08:30:00Z.</t>
          <t>Similarly, in the Australia/Melbourne time zone, the date-time 2020-10-04T02:30:00 does not exist;
	    the clocks are moved forward one hour for DST on that day at 02:00. However, such a value may appear
	      during calculations (see duration semantics in <xref target="type-Duration" format="default"/>) or
	        due to a change in time zone rules (so it was valid when the event was first created). Again, it is
		  interpreted as though the offset before the transition is in effect (+10:00); therefore, when
		    converted to UTC, we get 2020-10-03T16:30:00Z.</t>

        <section anchor="type-Duration" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Duration</name>
          <t>Where Duration is given as a type, it means a length of time represented by a subset of the ISO 8601 duration format, as specified by the following ABNF <xref target="RFC5234" format="default"/>:</t>

    duration    = "P" (dur-cal [dur-time] / dur-time)
]]></sourcecode>
          <t>In addition, the duration <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> include fractional second values unless the fraction is non-zero. Fractional second values <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> have trailing zeros to ensure there is only a single representation for each duration.</t>
          <t>A duration specifies an abstract number of weeks, days, hours, minutes, and/or seconds. A duration specified using weeks or days does not always correspond to an exact multiple of 24 hours. The number of hours/minutes/seconds may vary if it overlaps a period of discontinuity in the event's time zone, for example, a change from standard time to daylight savings time. Leap seconds <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be considered when adding or subtracting a duration to/from a LocalDateTime.</t>
          <t>To add a duration to a LocalDateTime:
          </t>
          <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>Add any week or day components of the duration to the date. A week is always the same as seven days.</li>

          <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>If a time zone applies to the LocalDateTime, convert it to UTC following the semantics in <xref target="type-LocalDateTime" format="default"/>.</li>
            <li>Subtract any hour, minute, or second components of the duration (in absolute time).</li>
            <li>Convert the resulting UTCDateTime back to LocalDateTime in the time zone that applies.</li>
            <li>Subtract any week or day components of the duration from the date.</li>
            <li>If the resulting time does not exist on the date due to a discontinuity in the time zone, use the semantics in <xref target="type-LocalDateTime" format="default"/> to convert to UTC and back to get a valid LocalDateTime.</li>

          <t>A PatchObject is of type <tt>String[*]</tt> and represents an unordered set of patches on a JSON

            <li>All parts prior to the last (i.e., the value after the final slash) <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> already
	        exist on the object being patched.</li>
            <li>There <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be two patches in the PatchObject where the pointer of one is the

            <li>The value for the patch <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be valid for the property being set (of the correct

          </ol>
          <t>The value associated with each pointer determines how to apply that patch:</t>

            <li>If null, remove the property from the patched object. If the key is not present in the parent, this a no-op.</li>
            <li>If non-null, set the value given as the value for this property
            (this may be a replacement or addition to the object being patched).</li>
          </ul>
          <t>A PatchObject does not define its own <tt>@type</tt> property (see <xref target="prop-type"
	    format="default"/>). An <tt>@type</tt> property in a patch <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be handled as any other
	    patched property value.</t>
          <t>Implementations <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reject a PatchObject in its entirety if any of its patches are
	    invalid.  Implementations <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> apply partial patches.</t>
          <t>The PatchObject format is used to significantly reduce file size and duplicated content when
	    specifying variations to a common object, such as with recurring events or when translating the data
	      into multiple languages. It can also better preserve semantic intent if only the properties that
	        should differ between the two objects are patched. For example, if one person is not going to a
		  particular instance of a regularly scheduled event, in iCalendar, you would have to duplicate the
		    entire event in the override. In JSCalendar, this is a small patch to show the difference. As only
		      this property is patched, if the location of the event is changed, the occurrence will automatically
		        still inherit this.</t>

        <name>Normalization and Equivalence</name>
        <t>JSCalendar aims to provide unambiguous definitions for value types and properties but does not
	define a general normalization or equivalence method for JSCalendar objects and types. This is because
	the notion of equivalence might range from byte-level equivalence to semantic equivalence, depending on
	the respective use case. Normalization of JSCalendar objects is hindered because of the following
	reasons:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Custom JSCalendar properties may contain arbitrary JSON values, including arrays. However,
	    equivalence of arrays might or might not depend on the order of elements, depending on the respective
	      property definition.</li>
          <li>Several JSCalendar property values are defined as URIs and media types, but normalization of
	    these types is inherently protocol and scheme specific, depending on the use case of the equivalence
	      definition (see <xref target="RFC3986" sectionFormat="of" section="6" />).</li>
        </ul>
        <t>Considering this, the definition of equivalence and normalization is left to client and server
	implementations and to be negotiated by a calendar exchange protocol or defined elsewhere.</t>

To avoid conflict, the names of these properties <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be prefixed by a domain name controlled by the vendor followed by a colon, e.g., <tt>example.com:customprop</tt>. If the value is a new JSCalendar object, it either <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include an <tt>@type</tt> property, or it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> explicitly be specified to not require a type designator.

          <t>This is a globally unique identifier used to associate objects representing the same event, task, group, or other object across different systems, calendars, and views.

          <t>If an object is split to make a "this and future" change to a recurrence, the original object <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be truncated to end at the previous occurrence before this split, and a new object is created to represent all the occurrences after the split.

		properties <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be considered in the order above, and:</t>
                <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
		    <li>After applying the byMonth filter, if the candidate's month is invalid for the given year, increment it (if skip is "forward") or decrement it (if skip is "backward") until a valid month is found, incrementing/decrementing the year as well if passing through the beginning/end of the year. This only applies to calendar systems with leap months.</li>
                  <li>After applying the byMonthDay filter, if the day of the month is invalid for the given month and year, change the date to the first day of the next month (if skip is "forward") or the last day of the current month (if skip is "backward").</li>
                  <li>If any valid date produced after applying the skip is already a candidate, eliminate the duplicate. (For example, after adjusting, February 30th and February 31st would both become the same "real" date, so one is eliminated as a duplicate.)</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>If a <tt>bySetPosition</tt> property is included, this is now applied to the ordered list of remaining dates. This property specifies the indexes of date-times to keep; all others should be eliminated. Negative numbers are indexed from the end of the list, with -1 being the last item, -2 the second from last, etc.</li>
              <li>Any date-times before the start date of the event are eliminated (see below for why this might be needed).</li>
              <li>If a <tt>skip</tt> property is included and is not "omit", eliminate any date-times that have already been produced by previous iterations of the algorithm. (This is not possible if skip is "omit".)</li>
              <li>If further dates are required (we have not reached the until date or count limit), skip the next (interval - 1) sets of candidates, then continue from step 1.</li>
            </ol>
            <t>When determining the set of occurrence dates for an event or task, the following extra rules
	        must be applied:</t>
            <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
	            <li>The initial date-time to which the rule is applied (the <tt>start</tt> date-time for events
		          or the <tt>start</tt> or <tt>due</tt> date-time for tasks) is always the first occurrence in the
			        expansion (and is counted if the recurrence is limited by a <tt>count</tt> property), even if it would
				      normally not match the rule.</li>
              <li>The first set of candidates to consider is that which would contain the initial date-time.


	            This means the first set may include candidates before the initial date-time; such candidates are
		          eliminated from the results in step 4 of the list above.</li>
              <li><t>The following properties <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be implicitly added to the rule under the

          <t>By default, an occurrence inherits all properties from the main object except the start (or due) date-time, which is shifted to match the recurrence id LocalDateTime.

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>Calendaring and scheduling information is very privacy sensitive.  It can reveal the social network of a user, location information of this user and those in their social network, identity and credentials information, and patterns of behavior of the user in both the physical and cyber realm. Additionally, calendar events and tasks can influence the physical location of a user or their cyber behavior within a known time window.  Its transmission and storage must be done carefully to protect it from possible threats, such as eavesdropping, replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, and on-path attacks.</t>
      <t>The data being stored and transmitted may be used in systems with real-world consequences. For example, a home automation system may turn an alarm on and off  or a coworking space may charge money to the organizer of an event that books one of their meeting rooms. Such systems must be careful to authenticate all data they receive to prevent them from being subverted and ensure the change comes from an authorized entity.</t>
      <t>This document only defines the data format; such considerations are primarily the concern of the API or method of storage and transmission of such files.</t>
      <section anchor="sec-recurrences" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Expanding Recurrences</name>
        <t>A recurrence rule may produce infinite occurrences of an event. Implementations <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> handle expansions carefully to prevent accidental or deliberate resource exhaustion.</t>
        <t>Conversely, a recurrence rule may be specified that does not expand to anything. It is not always possible to tell this through static analysis of the rule, so implementations <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be careful to avoid getting stuck in infinite loops or otherwise exhausting resources while searching for the next occurrence.</t>
        <t>Events recur in the event's time zone. If the user is in a different time zone, daylight saving transitions may cause an event that normally occurs at, for example, 9 am to suddenly shift an hour earlier. This may be used in an attempt to cause a participant to miss an important meeting. User agents must be careful to translate date-times correctly between time zones and may wish to call out unexpected changes in the time of a recurring event.</t>

      <section anchor="json-parsing" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>JSON Parsing</name>
        <t>The security considerations of <xref target="RFC8259" format="default"/> apply to the use of JSON as the data interchange format.
        </t>
        <t>As for any serialization format, parsers need to thoroughly check the syntax of the supplied data. JSON uses opening and closing tags for several types and structures, and it is possible that the end of the supplied data will be reached when scanning for a matching closing tag; this is an error condition, and implementations need to stop scanning at the end of the supplied data.</t>
        <t>JSON also uses a string encoding with some escape sequences to encode special characters within a string. Care is needed when processing these escape sequences to ensure that they are fully formed before the special processing is triggered, with special care taken when the escape sequences appear adjacent to other (non-escaped) special characters or adjacent to the end of data (as in the previous paragraph).</t>
        <t>If parsing JSON into a non-textual structured data format, implementations may need to allocate storage to hold JSON string elements.  Since JSON does not use explicit string lengths, the risk of denial of service due to resource exhaustion is small, but implementations may still wish to place limits on the size of allocations they are willing to make in any given context, to avoid untrusted data causing excessive memory allocation.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="uri-values" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>URI Values</name>
        <t>Several JSCalendar properties contain URIs as values, and processing these properties requires extra care. <xref target="RFC3986" sectionFormat="of" section="7"/> discusses security risks related to URIs.</t>
        <t>Fetching remote resources carries inherent risks. Connections must only be allowed on well-known ports, using allowed protocols (generally, just HTTP/HTTPS on their default ports). The URL must be resolved externally and not allowed to access internal resources. Connecting to an external source reveals IP (and therefore often location) information.</t>
        <t>A maliciously constructed JSCalendar object may contain a very large number of URIs. In the case of published calendars with a large number of subscribers, such objects could be widely distributed. Implementations should be careful to limit the automatic fetching of linked resources to reduce the risk of this being an amplification vector for a denial-of-service attack.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="spam" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Spam</name>
        <t>Calendar systems may receive JSCalendar files from untrusted sources, in particular, as attachments to emails. This can be a vector for an attacker to inject spam into a user's calendar. This may confuse, annoy, and mislead users or overwhelm their calendar with bogus events, preventing them from seeing legitimate ones.</t>
        <t>Heuristic, statistical, or machine-learning-based filters can be effective in filtering out spam. Authentication mechanisms, such as DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) <xref target="RFC6376" format="default"/>, can help establish the source of messages and associate the data with existing relationships (such as an address book contact). However, misclassifications are always possible and providing a mechanism for users to quickly correct this is advised.</t>
        <t>Confusable unicode characters may be used to trick a user into trusting a JSCalendar file that appears to come from a known contact but is actually from a similar-looking source controlled by an attacker.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="duplication" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Duplication</name>
        <t>It is important for calendar systems to maintain the UID of an event when updating it to avoid an unexpected duplication of events. Consumers of the data may not remove the previous version of the event if it has a different UID. This can lead to a confusing situation for the user, with many variations of the event and no indication of which one is correct. Care must be taken by consumers of the data to remove old events where possible to avoid an accidental denial-of-service attack due to the volume of data.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="timezonesec" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Time Zones</name>
        <t>Events recur in a particular time zone. When this differs from the user's current time zone, it may unexpectedly cause an occurrence to shift in time for that user due to a daylight savings change in the event's time zone. A maliciously crafted event could attempt to confuse users with such an event to ensure a meeting is missed.</t>

        <name>Changes to the "JSCalendar Properties" Registry</name>
        <t>When <xref target="RFC8984"/> was published, IANA has created the "JSCalendar Properties" registry to allow interoperability of extensions to JSCalendar objects. As this RFC document obsoletes <xref target="RFC8984"/> the IANA registry contents and update rules shall be completely replaced with the following definitions.</t>
        <t>This registry follows the Expert Review process (<xref target="RFC8126" sectionFormat="comma" section="4.5"/>). If the "Intended Usage" field is <tt>common</tt>, sufficient documentation is required to enable interoperability. Preliminary community review for this registry is optional but strongly encouraged.</t>
        <t>A registration can have an intended usage of <tt>common</tt>, <tt>reserved</tt>, or <tt>obsolete</tt>. IANA will list registrations with a common usage designation prominently and separately from those with other intended usage values.</t>
        <t>A <tt>reserved</tt> registration reserves a property name without assigning semantics to avoid name collisions with future extensions or protocol use.</t>
        <t>An <tt>obsolete</tt> registration denotes a property that is no longer expected to be added by up-to-date systems. A new property has probably been defined covering the obsolete property's semantics.</t>
        <t>The JSCalendar property registration procedure is not a formal standards process but rather an administrative procedure intended to allow community comment and check it is coherent without excessive time delay. It is designed to encourage vendors to document and register new properties they add for use cases not covered by the original specification, leading to increased interoperability.</t>

          <name>Designated Expert Review</name>
          <t>The primary concern of the designated expert (DE) is preventing name collisions and encouraging
	    the submitter to document security and privacy considerations. For a common-use registration, the DE
	      is expected to confirm that suitable documentation, as described in <xref target="RFC8126"
	        sectionFormat="of" section="4.6"/>, is available to ensure interoperability. That documentation will
	        usually be in an RFC, but simple definitions are likely to use a web/wiki page, and if a sentence or
		  two is deemed sufficient, it could be described in the registry itself. The DE should also verify that
		    the property name does not conflict with work that is active or already published within the IETF. A
		      published specification is not required for reserved or obsolete registrations.</t>
          <t>The DE will either approve or deny the registration request and publish a notice of the decision
	    to the Calext WG mailing list or its successor, as well as inform IANA. A denial notice must be
	      justified by an explanation, and, in the cases where it is possible, concrete suggestions on how the
	        request can be modified so as to become acceptable should be provided.</t>

          <name>Change Procedures</name>
          <t>Once a JSCalendar property has been published by IANA, the change controller may request a
	    change to its definition. The same procedure that would be appropriate for the original registration
	      request is used to process a change request.</t>
          <t>JSCalendar property registrations may not be deleted; properties that are no longer believed appropriate for use can be declared obsolete by a change to their "intended usage" field; such properties will be clearly marked in the IANA registry.</t>
          <t>Significant changes to a JSCalendar property's definition should be requested only when there are
	    serious omissions or errors in the published specification, as such changes may cause
	      interoperability issues. When review is required, a change request may be denied if it renders
	        entities that were valid under the previous definition invalid under the new definition.</t>
          <t>The owner of a JSCalendar property may pass responsibility to another person or agency by
	    informing IANA; this can be done without discussion or review.</t>

<!--[rfced] AUTH48 IANA Changes:

1) Note that we will communicate changes to Table 1 to IANA so that https://www.iana.org/assignments/jscalendar/jscalendar.xhtml can be updated to match once AUTH48 completes.

2) We will take the same action for Tables 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, and 15 (so they may update section numbers or Context names as the case may be).

3) With regard to Table 5, we assume that this will be new information to be registered with IANA for display at https://www.iana.org/assignments/jscalendar/jscalendar.xhtml.  Once we have AD approval of this text, we will communicate this requested subregistry to IANA.

Please let us know any objections.

        <t>When <xref target="RFC8984"/> was published, IANA has created the "JSCalendar Enum Values" registry to allow interoperable extension of semantics for properties with enumerable values.
