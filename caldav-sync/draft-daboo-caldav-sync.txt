1.  Introduction

   The CalDAV [RFC4791] protocol is a client/server protocol that
   supports the exchange of iCalendar [RFC5545] data between a server
   and clients, as well as supporting scheduling operations on the
   server (using [RFC6638]).  To exchange data, clients and servers use
   a combination of HTTP PUT, GET and REPORT requests.  The REPORT
   requests include CalDAV "multiget" and "time-range" queries, as well
   as WebDAV-based synchronization [RFC6578].  Whilst these have proved
   adequate to date, there is a need to improve the efficiency of data
   synchronization to lower network I/O requirements, and thus reduce
   power consumption requirements on mobile devices (which are now
   frequently used to manage calendars).

   The iCalendar patch [draft-patch] specification defines a way for
   clients to incrementally update servers using the HTTP PATCH
   [RFC5789] method and a new iCalendar-based patch format.  This allows
   a client to only send the pieces of an iCalendar object that have
   changed, rather than send the entire resource.  This can
   significantly reduce the amount of data sent from the client to the
   server, particularly in enterprise environments where long-lived
   recurring events, with many attendees, and many recurrence exceptions
   are common.  However, when data changes on the server, clients are
   still required to download the entire calendar resource, even when
   only a small change has taken place.  Since many users now have
   multiple devices that are actively synchronizing with a server (e.g.,
   desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, etc) a small change made on

   one device will result in large data transfers on the others as they
   synchronize their local caches.

   This specification defines new protocol features in CalDAV to support
   incremental updates to data stored in a client's cache, by sending
   calendar patch data from the server to the client.  These features
   are intended to be data format agnostic, and can be used with
   iCalendar patch, and future patch formats whether they be for
   existing (e.g. jCal [RFC7265], xCal [RFC6321]) or new calendar data
   formats.

3.  Overview

   Synchronization of CalDAV data on a client is nowadays typically
   accomplished using the WebDAV sync REPORT to detect changes to
   individual calendar object resources in a calendar collection.  Those
   can be retrieved by the WebDAV sync request itself, or a subsequent
   series of CalDAV multiget requests can be made to retrieve the
   changed data.  WebDAV sync defines a DAV:sync-token property on
   collections that support synchronization.  The value of that property
   is an opaque token that serves as a "sync anchor" for retrieval of
   changes on the server.  Each client that maintains a local cache of
   the data stores the last value of DAV:sync-token for a fully
   synchronized calendar collection, and then presents that token to the
   server the next time changes need to be fetched.  The server then
   uses that token to determine what has changed since the client last
   synchronized, and can return those changes.  Since the DAV:sync-token
   is already being used to track changes on a collection level, it can
   also be used as a "sync anchor" for the retrieval of incremental
   changes to the resources within that collection.

Internet-Draft       CalDAV Enhanced Synchronization       February 2017


   This specification makes the following changes to CalDAV (with
   details of each described in subsequent sections):

   o  HTTP requests that expect calendar data to be included in the
      response (GET and REPORTs which include the CALDAV:calendar-data
      "property" in the XML body) can include a Prefer request header
      field [RFC7240] with the "calendar-patch" preference.  The client
      sets the value of the "since" parameter of this preference to a
      DAV:sync-token value.  When such a request is received by the
      server, if the "since" value represents a valid "sync anchor", the
      server MAY use calendar patch documents in the HTTP response.
      Those documents represent the difference between each calendar
      resource as it was at the time the client-provided "sync anchor"
      was in effect, and the current state of the resource.

   o  HTTP multi-status responses that include calendar patch documents
      MAY use a 304 (Not Modified) status code inside a DAV:propstat
      element containing a CALDAV:calendar-data element to indicate that
      there is no difference between the current state of the resource
      and the state indicated by the "sync anchor".

4.  The "calendar-patch" Preference

   The "calendar-patch" preference indicates that the client wishes for
   the server to use calendar patch documents in the HTTP response
   rather than entire calendar resources.  The value of the "since"
   parameter, which MUST be the value of a previously returned DAV:sync-
   token property, provides the "sync anchor" from which the server
   should generate the patch documents.

   ABNF:

   calendar-patch = "calendar-patch" OWS ";" OWS "since=" sync-token

   sync-token = DQUOTE absolute-URI DQUOTE

5.  Changes to GET requests

   A client can signal to a server that it is willing and able to
   receive a calendar patch document rather than an entire calendar
   resource by including a Prefer header field with the "calendar-patch"
   preference in a GET request.

   If a server receives a "calendar-patch" preference, recognizes the
   supplied sync-token, and is able to create a patch document for the
   resource in a format compatible with one of the media types supplied
   in the Accept [RFC7230] request header field, the server MAY respond

   to the request with the patch document in lieu of the entire
   resource.

   Example:

   >> Request <<

   GET /events/abcd.ics HTTP/1.1
   Host: cal.example.com
   Prefer: calendar-patch; since="http://example.com/ns/sync/1234"

6.  Changes to CalDAV REPORT requests

   A client fetching the CALDAV:calendar-data "property" in a
   CALDAV:calendar-query or CALDAV:calendar-multiget REPORT can signal
   to a server that it is willing and able to receive calendar patch
   documents rather than entire calendar resources by including a Prefer
   header field with the "calendar-patch" preference in the REPORT
   request.

   If a server receives a "calendar-patch" preference, recognizes the
   supplied sync-token, and is able to create patch documents for
   resources in a format compatible with the "content-type" attribute of
   the CALDAV:calendar-data element, the server MAY respond to the
   request with patch documents in lieu of entire resources.  If a
   resource has not changed since the state indicated by the sync-token,
   the server MAY respond with a 304 (Not Modified) status code in the
   DAV:propstat element containing the CALDAV:calendar-data element in
   lieu of an empty calendar patch document.

   Example:

   >> Request <<

7.  Changes to WebDAV Sync Collection REPORT requests

   A client fetching the CALDAV:calendar-data "property" in a DAV:sync-
   collection REPORT can signal to a server that it is willing and able
   to receive calendar patch documents rather than entire calendar
   resources by including a Prefer header field with the "calendar-
   patch" preference in the REPORT request.  The value of the sync-token
   specified in the Prefer request header field MUST match that of the
   DAV:sync-token element in the REPORT body.

   If a server receives a "calendar-patch" preference, recognizes the
   supplied sync-token, and is able to create patch documents for
   resources in a format compatible with the "content-type" attribute of
   the CALDAV:calendar-data element, the server MAY respond to the
   request with patch documents in lieu of entire resources.  If a
   resource has not changed since the state indicated by the sync-token,
   the server MAY respond with a 304 (Not Modified) status code in the
   DAV:propstat element containing the CALDAV:calendar-data element in
   lieu of an empty calendar patch document.

   Example:

   >> Request <<

   REPORT /events/work/ HTTP/1.1
   Host: cal.example.com
   Content-Type: text/xml; charset="utf-8"
   Content-Length: xxxx

10.  IANA Considerations

   The following preference is to be added to the HTTP Preferences
   Registry defined in Section 5.1 of [RFC7240].

   Preference:  calendar-patch

   Parameters:  since = <sync-token>

   Description:  The "calendar-patch" preference indicates that the
      client wishes for the server to use calendar patch documents in
      the HTTP response rather than entire calendar resources.  The
      value of the "since" parameter provides the anchor point from
      which the server should generate the patch documents.

   Reference:  RFCXXXX, Section 4

   Notes:  This preference is only intended to be used with CalDAV
      requests that expect calendar data to be included in the response.
      Furthermore, the "since" parameter is REQUIRED with this
      preference.
