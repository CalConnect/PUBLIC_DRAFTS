1.  Introduction

   iCalendar entities often need to be related to each other or to
   associated meta-data.  These relationships can take the following
   forms

   Structured iCalendar:  iCalendar entities are related to each other
      in some structured way, for example as parent, sibling, before,
      after.

   Grouped iCalendar:  iCalendar entities are related to each other as a
      group.  CATEGORIES are often used for this purpose but are
      problematic for application developers.

   Linked:  Entities are linked to each other through typed references.

Internet-Draft           iCalendar Relationships                May 2018


1.1.  Structured iCalendar relationships

   The currently existing iCalendar [RFC5545] RELATED-TO property has no
   support for temporal relationships as used by standard project
   management tools.

   The RELTYPE parameter is extended to take new values defining
   temporal relationships, a GAP parameter is defined to provide lead
   and lag values and RELATED-TO is extended to allow URI values.  These
   changes allow the RELATED-TO property to define a richer set of
   relationships useful for project management.

1.2.  Grouped iCalendar relationships

   This specification defines a new REFID property which allows
   arbitrary groups of entities to be associated with the same key
   value.

   REFID is used to identify a key allowing the association of
   components that are related to the same object and retrieval of a
   component based on this key.  This may be, for example, to identify
   the tasks associated with a given project without having to
   communicate the task structure of the project, or, for example, in a
   package delivery system all tasks associated to a specific package.

   As such, the presence of a REFID property imparts no meaning to the
   component.  It is merely a key to allow retrieval.  This is distinct
   from categorisation which, while allowing grouping also adds meaning
   to the component to which it is attached.

1.3.  Concept relationships

   The name CONCEPT is used by the Simple Knowledge Organization System
   defined in [W3C.CR-skos-reference-20090317].  This more accurately
   defines what we mean by a category.  It's not the words but the
   meaning.

   The introduction of CONCEPT allows a more structured approach to
   categorization, with the possibility of namespaced and path-like
   values.  Unlike REFID the CONCEPT property imparts some meaning.  It
   is assumed that the value of this property will reference a well
   defined category.

   The current [RFC5545] CATEGORY property is used as a free form
   'tagging' field.  As such it is difficult to establish formal
   relationships between components based on their category.

Internet-Draft           iCalendar Relationships                May 2018


   Rather than attempt to add semantics to the current property it
   seeems best to continue its usage as an informal tag and establish a
   new property with more constraints.

1.4.  Linked relationships

   The currently existing iCalendar standard [RFC5545] lacks a general
   purpose method for referencing additional, external information
   relating to calendar components.

   This document proposes a method for referencing typed external
   information that can provide additional information about an
   iCalendar component.  This new LINK property is closely aligned to
   the LINK header defined in [RFC5988]

   The LINK property defines a typed reference or relation to external
   meta-data or related resources.  By providing type and format
   information as parameters, clients and servers are able to discover
   interesting references and make use of them, perhaps for indexing or
   the presentation of interesting links for the user.

   It is often necessary to relate calendar components.  The current
   RELATED-TO property only allows for a UID which is inadequate for
   many purposes.  Allowing other value types for that property may help
   but might raise a number of backward compatibility issues.  The link
   property can link components in different collections or even on
   different servers.

   When publishing events it is useful to be able to refer back to the
   source of that information.  The actual event may have been consumed
   from a feed or an ics file on a web site.  A LINK property can
   provide a reference to the originator of the event.

   Beyond the need to relate elements temporally, project management
   tools often need to be able to specify the relationships between the
   various events and tasks which make up a project.  The LINK property
   provides such a mechanism.

   The LINK property SHOULD NOT be treated as just another attachment.
   The ATTACH property is being extended to handle server-side
   management and stripping of inline data.  Clients may choose to
   handle attachments differently as they are often an integral part of
   the message - for example, the agenda.  See
   [I-D.daboo-caldav-attachments]

1.5.  Caching and offline use

   To facilitate offline display the link type may identify important
   pieces of data which should be downloaded in advance.

   In general, the calendar entity should be self explanatory without
   the need to download referenced meta-data such as a web page.

1.6.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.  Reference Types

   The actual reference value can take three forms specified by the type
   parameter

   URI:  The default type.  This is a URI referring to the target.

   UID:  This allows for linking within a single collection and the
      value is assumed to be another component within that collection.

   REFERENCE:  An xpointer.  In an XML environment it may be necessary
      to refer to an external XML artifact.  The XPointer is defined in
      [W3C.WD-xptr-xpointer-20021219] and allows addressing portions of
      XML documents.

3.  Link Relation Types

   [RFC5988] defines two forms of relation type, registered and
   extension.  Registered relation types are added to a registry defined
   by [RFC5988] while extension relation types are specified as unique
   unregistered URIs, (at least unregistered in the [RFC5988] registry).

   The relation types defined here will be registered with IANA in
   accordance with the specifications in [RFC5988].

4.  Redefined Relation Type Value

   Relationship parameter type values are defined in section 3.2.15. of
   [RFC5545].  This specification redefines that type to include the new
   temporal relationship values FINISHTOSTART, FINISHTOFINISH,
   STARTTOFINISH and STARTTOSTART.  It also adds the DEPENDS-ON value to
   provide a link to a component upon which the current component
   depends.

   Format Definition:

   This property parameter is defined by the following notation:

     reltypeparam   = "RELTYPE" "="
                      ("PARENT"    ; Parent relationship - Default
                     / "CHILD"     ; Child relationship
                     / "SIBLING"   ; Sibling relationship
                     / "DEPENDS-ON" ; refers to previous component
                     / "REFID"     ; Relationship based on REFID
                     / "CONCEPT"
                             ; Relationship based on CONCEPT
                     / "FINISHTOSTART" ;  Temporal relationship
                     / "FINISHTOFINISH" ;  Temporal relationship
                     / "STARTTOFINISH" ;  Temporal relationship
                     / "STARTTOSTART" ;  Temporal relationship
                     / iana-token  ; Some other IANA-registered
                                   ; iCalendar relationship type
                     / x-name)     ; A non-standard, experimental
                                   ; relationship type

   Description:  This parameter can be specified on a property that
      references another related calendar component.  The parameter may
      specify the hierarchical relationship type of the calendar
      component referenced by the property when the value is PARENT,
      CHILD or SIBLING.  If this parameter is not specified on an
      allowable property, the default relationship type is PARENT.
      Applications MUST treat x-name and iana-token values they don't
      recognize the same way as they would the PARENT value.

      This parameter defines the temporal relationship when the value is
      one of the project management standard relationships
      FINISHTOSTART, FINISHTOFINISH, STARTTOFINISH or STARTTOSTART.
      This property will be present in the predecessor entity and will
      refer to the successor entity.  The GAP parameter specifies the
      lead or lag time between the predecessor and the successor.  In
      the description of each temporal relationship below we refer to
      Task-A which contains and controls the relationship and Task-B the
      target of the relationship.

   RELTYPE=PARENT:  See [RFC5545] section 3.2.15.

   RELTYPE=CHILD:  See [RFC5545] section 3.2.15.

   RELTYPE=SIBLING:  See [RFC5545] section 3.2.15.

   RELTYPE=DEPENDS-ON:  Indicates that the current calendar component
      depends on the referenced calendar component in some manner.  For

      example a task may be blocked waiting on the other, referenced,
      task.

   RELTYPE=REFID:  Establishes a reference from the current component to
      components with a REFID property which matches the value given in
      the associated RELATED-TO property.

   RELTYPE=CONCEPT:  Establishes a reference from the current component
      to components with a CONCEPT property which matches the value
      given in the associated RELATED-TO property.

   RELTYPE=FINISHTOSTART:  Task-B cannot start until Task-A finishes.
      For example, when sanding is complete, painting can begin.


               ============
               |  Task-A  |--+
               ============  |
                             |
                             V
                             ============
                             |  Task-B  |
                             ============

                  Figure 1: Finish to start relationship

   RELTYPE=FINISHTOFINISH:  Task-B cannot finish before Task-A is
      finished, that is the end of Task-A defines the end of Task-B.
      For example, we start the potatoes, then the meat then the peas
      but they should all be cooked at the same time.


                       ============
                       |  Task-A  |--+
                       ============  |
                                     |
                       ============  |
                       |  Task-B  |<-+
                       ============

                  Figure 2: Finish to finish relationship

   RELTYPE=STARTTOFINISH:  The start of Task-A (which occurs after Task-
      B) controls the finish of Task-B.  For example, ticket sales
      (Task-B) end when the game starts (Task-A).

5.  New Property Parameters

5.1.  Rel

   Parameter name:  REL

   Purpose:  To specify the relationship of data referenced by a LINK
      property.

   Format Definition:

   This parameter is defined by the following notation:

     relparam     = "REL" "="
                    ("SOURCE"      ; Link to source of this component
                    / DQUOTE uri DQUOTE
                    / x-name        ; Experimental reference type
                    / iana-token)   ; Other IANA registered type

   Description:  This parameter MUST be specified on all LINK
      properties, and defines the type of reference.  This allows
      programs consuming this data to automatically scan for references
      they support.  In addition to the values defined here any value

      defined in [RFC5988] may be used.  There is no default relation
      type.

   REL=SOURCE:  identifies the source of the event information.

   Registration:  These relation types are registered in [RFC5988]

5.2.  Gap

   Parameter name:  GAP

   Purpose:  To specify the length of the gap, positive or negative
      between two temporaly related components.

   Format Definition:

   This parameter is defined by the following notation:

     gapparam      = "GAP" "=" dur-value

   Description:  This parameter MAY be specified on the RELATED-TO
      property, and defines the duration of time between the predecessor
      and successor in an interval.  When positive it defines the lag
      time between a task and its logical successor.  When negative it
      defines the lead time.

      An example of lag time might be if task A is "paint the room" and
      task B is "hang the drapes" then task A may be related to task B
      with RELTYPE=FINISHTOSTART with a gap long enough for the paint to
      dry.

      An example of lead time might be to relate a 1 week task A to the
      end of task B with RELTYPE=STARTTOFINISH and a negative gap of 1
      week so they finish at the same time.

6.  New Value Data Types

   This specification defines the following new value types to be used
   with the VALUE property parameter:

   UID  VALUE=UID indicates that the associated value is the UID for a
      component.

   REFERENCE  VALUE=REFERENCE indicates that the associated value is an
      xpointer referencing an associated XML artifact.

7.  New Properties

7.1.  Concept

   Property name:  CONCEPT

   Purpose:  This property defines the formal categories for a calendar
      component.

   Value type:  URI

   Property Parameters:  IANA, and non-standard parameters can be
      specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified zero or more times in
      any iCalendar component.

   Description:  This property is used to specify formal categories or
      classifications of the calendar component.  The values are useful
      in searching for a calendar component of a particular type and
      category.

      Within the "VEVENT", "VTODO", or "VJOURNAL" calendar components,
      more than one formal category can be specified by using multiple
      CONCEPT properties.

      This categorization is distinct from the more informal "tagging"
      of components provided by the existing CATEGORIES property.  It is
      expected that the value of the CONCEPT property will reference an
      external resource which provides information about the
      categorization.

      In addition, a structured URI value allows for hierarchical
      categorization of events.

      Possible category resources are the various proprietary systems,
      for example Library of Congress, or an open source derived from
      something like the dmoz.org data.

7.3.  Refid

   Property name:  REFID

   Purpose:  This property value acts as a key for associated iCalendar
      entities.

   Value type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard parameters can be specified on
      this property.

   Conformance:  This property MAY be specified multiple times in any
      iCalendar component.

   Description:  The value of this property is a text identifier that
      allows associated components to be located or retrieved as a
      whole.  For example all of the events in a travel itinerary would
      have the same REFID value.

   Format Definition:

   This property is defined by the following notation:

     refid      = "REFID" refidparam ":" text CRLF


     refidparam      = *(

                     ; the following is OPTIONAL

8.1.  RELATED-TO

   Property name:  RELATED-TO

   Purpose:  This property is used to represent a relationship or
      reference between one calendar component and another.  The
      definition here extends the definition in Section 3.8.4.5. of
      [RFC5545] by allowing URI or UID values and a GAP parameter.

   Value type:  URI, UID or TEXT

   Property Parameters:  Relationship type, IANA and non-standard
      property parameters can be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property MAY be specified in any iCalendar
      component.

   Description:  By default or when VALUE=UID is specified, the property
      value consists of the persistent, globally unique identifier of
      another calendar component.  This value would be represented in a
      calendar component by the "UID" property.

      By default, the property value points to another calendar
      component that has a PARENT relationship to the referencing
      object.  The "RELTYPE" property parameter is used to either
      explicitly state the default PARENT relationship type to the
      referenced calendar component or to override the default PARENT
      relationship type and specify either a CHILD or SIBLING
      relationship or a temporal relationship.

      The PARENT relationship indicates that the calendar component is a
      subordinate of the referenced calendar component.  The CHILD
      relationship indicates that the calendar component is a superior
      of the referenced calendar component.  The SIBLING relationship
      indicates that the calendar component is a peer of the referenced
      calendar component.

      The FINISHTOSTART, FINISHTOFINISH, STARTTOFINISH or STARTTOSTART
      relationships define temporal relationships as specified in the
      reltype parameter definition.

      Changes to a calendar component referenced by this property can
      have an implicit impact on the related calendar component.  For
      example, if a group event changes its start or end date or time,
      then the related, dependent events will need to have their start
      and end dates changed in a corresponding way.  Similarly, if a
      PARENT calendar component is cancelled or deleted, then there is
      an implied impact to the related CHILD calendar components.  This

      property is intended only to provide information on the
      relationship of calendar components.  It is up to the target
      calendar system to maintain any property implications of this
      relationship.

   Format Definition:

   This property is defined by the following notation:

     related    = "RELATED-TO" relparam ( ":" text ) /
                  (
                    ";" "VALUE" "=" "UID"
                    ":" uid
                  )
                  (
                    ";" "VALUE" "=" "URI"
                    ":" uri
                  )
                  CRLF

     relparam   = *(
                 ;
                 ; The following are OPTIONAL,
                 ; but MUST NOT occur more than once.

                 ;
                 ; The following is OPTIONAL,
                 ; and MAY occur more than once.

                 (";" other-param)
                 ;
