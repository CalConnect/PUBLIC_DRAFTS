1.  Introduction

   iCalendar entities defined in [RFC5545] often need to be related to
   each other or to associated meta-data.  The specifications below
   support relationships of the following forms:

   Structured iCalendar:  iCalendar entities can be related to each
      other in some structured way, for example as parent, sibling,
      before, after.

   Grouped iCalendar:  iCalendar entities can be related to each other
      as a group.  CATEGORIES are often used for this purpose but are

Internet-Draft           iCalendar Relationships            January 2022


      problematic for application developers due to their lack of
      consistency and use as a free-form tag.

   Linked:  Entities can be linked to other entities such as vcards
      through a URI and associated REL and FMTTYPE parameters.

1.1.  Structured iCalendar relationships

   The iCalendar [RFC5545] RELATED-TO property has no support for
   temporal relationships as used by standard project management tools.

   The RELTYPE parameter is extended to take new values defining
   temporal relationships, a GAP parameter is defined to provide lead
   and lag values, and RELATED-TO is extended to allow URI values.
   These changes allow the RELATED-TO property to define a richer set of
   relationships useful for project management.

1.2.  Grouped iCalendar relationships

   This specification defines a new REFID property which allows
   arbitrary groups of entities to be associated with the same key
   value.

   REFID is used to identify a key allowing the association of
   components that are related to the same object and retrieval of a
   component based on this key.  Two examples of how this may be used
   are to identify the tasks associated with a given project without
   having to communicate the task structure of the project, and to group
   all tasks associated to a specific package in a package delivery
   system.

   As such, the presence of a REFID property imparts no meaning to the
   component.  It is merely a key to allow retrieval.  This is distinct
   from categorisation which, while allowing grouping also adds meaning
   to the component to which it is attached.

1.3.  Concept relationships

   The name CONCEPT is used by the Simple Knowledge Organization System
   defined in [W3C.REC-skos-reference-20090818].  The term "concept"
   more accurately defines what we often mean by a category.  It's not
   the text string that is important but the meaning attached to it.
   For example, the term "football" can mean very different sports.

   The introduction of CONCEPT allows a more structured approach to
   categorization, with the possibility of namespaced and path-like
   values.  Unlike REFID the CONCEPT property imparts some meaning.  It




Douglass                  Expires July 27, 2022                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft           iCalendar Relationships            January 2022


   is assumed that the value of this property will reference a well
   defined category.

   The current [RFC5545] CATEGORY property is used as a free form
   'tagging' field.  As such it is difficult to establish formal
   relationships between components based on their category.

   Rather than attempt to add semantics to the CATEGORY property it
   seems best to continue its usage as an informal tag and establish a
   new CONCEPT property with more constraints.

1.4.  Linked relationships

   The currently existing iCalendar standard [RFC5545] lacks a general
   purpose method for referencing additional, external information
   relating to calendar components.

   This document proposes a method for referencing typed external
   information that can provide additional information about an
   iCalendar component.  This new LINK property is closely aligned to
   the LINK header defined in [RFC8288]

   The LINK property defines a typed reference or relation to external
   meta-data or related resources.  By providing type and format
   information as parameters, clients and servers are able to discover
   interesting references and make use of them, perhaps for indexing or
   the presentation of interesting links for the user.

   It is also often necessary to reference calendar components in other
   collections.  For example, a VEVENT might refer to a VTODO from which
   it was derived.  The PARENT, SIBLING and CHILD relationships defined
   for the RELATED-TO property only allow for a UID which is inadequate
   for many purposes.  Allowing other value types for those
   relationships may help but would cause backward compatibility issues.
   The LINK property can link components in different collections or
   even on different servers.

   When publishing events it is useful to be able to refer back to the
   source of that information.  The actual event may have been consumed
   from a feed or an ics file on a web site.  A LINK property can
   provide a reference to the originator of the event.

   Beyond the need to relate elements temporally, project management
   tools often need to be able to specify the relationships between the
   various events and tasks which make up a project.  The LINK property
   provides such a mechanism.

Internet-Draft           iCalendar Relationships            January 2022


   The LINK property MUST NOT be treated as just another attachment.
   The ATTACH property defined in [RFC5545] is being extended to handle
   server-side management and stripping of inline data.  Clients may
   choose to handle attachments differently from the LINK property as
   they are often an integral part of the message - for example, the
   agenda.

   For more information on managed attachments see [RFC8607]

1.5.  Caching and offline use

   To facilitate offline display the link type may identify important
   pieces of data which should be downloaded in advance.

   In general, the calendar entity should be self explanatory without
   the need to download referenced meta-data such as a web page.

1.6.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Reference Types

   The actual reference value can take three forms specified by the type
   parameter

   URI:  The default type.  This is a URI referring to the target.

   UID:  This allows for linking within a single collection and the
      value MUST be another component within that collection.

   REFERENCE:  In an XML environment it may be necessary to refer to a
      fragment of an external XML artifact.  This value is a URI with an
      XPointer anchor value.  The XPointer is defined in
      [W3C.WD-xptr-xpointer-20021219] and it's use as an anchor is
      defined in [W3C.REC-xptr-framework-20030325]

3.  Link Relation Types

   [RFC8288] defines two forms of relation type: registered and
   extension.  Registered relation types are added to the Link Relations
   registry as specified in Section 2.1.1 of [RFC8288].  Extension
   relation types, defined in Section 2.1.2 of [RFC8288], are specified
   as unique URIs that are not registered in the registry.

Internet-Draft           iCalendar Relationships            January 2022


   The relation types defined in Section 6.1 will be registered with
   IANA in accordance with the specifications in [RFC8288].

4.  New temporal RELTYPE Parameter values

   This section defines the usual temporal relationships for use with
   the RELTYPE parameter defined in Section 3.2.15 of [RFC5545]:
   FINISHTOSTART, FINISHTOFINISH, STARTTOFINISH or STARTTOSTART.

   The [RFC5545] RELATED-TO property with one or more of these temporal
   relationships will be present in the predecessor entity and will
   refer to the successor entity.

   The GAP parameter (see Section 6.2) specifies the lead or lag time
   between the predecessor and the successor.  In the description of
   each temporal relationship below we refer to Task-A, which contains
   and controls the relationship, and Task-B the target of the
   relationship.

   RELTYPE=FINISHTOSTART:  Task-B cannot start until Task-A finishes.
      For example, when sanding is complete, painting can begin.


               ============
               |  Task-A  |--+
               ============  |
                             |
                             V
                             ============
                             |  Task-B  |
                             ============

                  Figure 1: Finish to start relationship

   RELTYPE=FINISHTOFINISH:  Task-B can only be completed after Task-A is
      finished.  The related tasks may run in parallel before
      completion.

      For example, if the goal is to prepare a meal, we start the
      potatoes, then the meat then the peas but they should all be
      cooked at the same time.

                       ==================
                       |     Task-A     |--+
                       ==================  |
                                           |
                             ============  |
                             |  Task-B  |<-+
                             ============

                  Figure 2: Finish to finish relationship

   RELTYPE=STARTTOFINISH:  The start of Task-A (which occurs after Task-
      B) controls the finish of Task-B.  For example, ticket sales
      (Task-B) end when the game starts (Task-A).


                                        ============
                                     +--|  Task-A  |
                                     |  ============
                                     |
                       ============  |
                       |  Task-B  |<-+
                       ============

                  Figure 3: Start to finish relationship

   RELTYPE=STARTTOSTART:  The start of Task-A triggers the start of
      Task-B, that is Task-B can start anytime after Task-A starts.


                       ============
                    +--|  Task-A  |
                    |  ============
                    |
                    |  ============
                    +->|  Task-B  |
                       ============

5.  Additional New RELTYPE Parameter Values

   This section defines the additional relationships below:

   RELTYPE=FIRST:  Indicates that the referenced calendar component is
      the first in a series the referenced calendar component is part
      of.

Internet-Draft           iCalendar Relationships            January 2022


   RELTYPE=DEPENDS-ON:  Indicates that the current calendar component
      depends on the referenced calendar component in some manner.  For
      example a task may be blocked waiting on the other, referenced,
      task.

   RELTYPE=REFID:  Establishes a reference from the current component to
      components with a REFID property which matches the value given in
      the associated RELATED-TO property.

   RELTYPE=CONCEPT:  Establishes a reference from the current component
      to components with a CONCEPT property which matches the value
      given in the associated RELATED-TO property.

6.  New Property Parameters

6.1.  Link Relation

   Parameter name:  LINKREL

   Purpose:  To specify the relationship of data referenced by a LINK
      property.

   Format Definition:

   This parameter is defined by the following notation:

     linkrelparam = "LINKREL" "="
                    ("SOURCE"      ; Link to source of this component
                    / DQUOTE uri DQUOTE
                    / iana-token)   ; Other IANA registered type

   Description:  This parameter MUST be specified on all LINK
      properties, and defines the type of reference.  This allows
      programs consuming this data to automatically scan for references
      they support.  There is no default relation type.

      In addition to the values defined here any value defined in
      [RFC8288] may be used.  However these uses SHOULD be documented in
      an RFC updating both [RFC5545] and [RFC8288]

   LINKREL=SOURCE:  identifies the source of the event information.

   Registration:  These relation types are registered in [RFC8288]

Internet-Draft           iCalendar Relationships            January 2022


6.2.  Gap

   Parameter name:  GAP

   Purpose:  To specify the length of the gap, positive or negative,
      between two temporaly related components.

   Format Definition:

   This parameter is defined by the following notation:

     gapparam      = "GAP" "=" dur-value

   Description:  This parameter MAY be specified on the RELATED-TO
      property, and defines the duration of time between the predecessor
      and successor in an interval.  When positive it defines the lag
      time between a task and its logical successor.  When negative it
      defines the lead time.

      An example of lag time might be if task A is "paint the room" and
      task B is "hang the drapes" then task A may be related to task B
      with RELTYPE=FINISHTOSTART with a gap long enough for the paint to
      dry.

      An example of lead time might be to relate a 1 week task A to the
      end of task B with RELTYPE=STARTTOFINISH and a negative gap of 1
      week so they finish at the same time.

7.  New Value Data Types

   This specification defines the following new value types to be used
   with the VALUE property parameter:

   UID  VALUE=UID indicates that the associated value is the UID for a
      component.

   REFERENCE  VALUE=REFERENCE indicates that the associated value
      references an associated XML artifact and is a URI with an
      XPointer anchor value.  The XPointer is defined in
      [W3C.WD-xptr-xpointer-20021219] and it's use as an anchor is
      defined in [W3C.REC-xptr-framework-20030325].

8.1.  Concept

   Property name:  CONCEPT

   Purpose:  This property defines the formal categories for a calendar
      component.

   Value type:  URI

   Property Parameters:  IANA, and non-standard parameters can be
      specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified zero or more times in
      any iCalendar component.

   Description:  This property is used to specify formal categories or
      classifications of the calendar component.  The values are useful
      in searching for a calendar component of a particular type and
      category.

      Within the "VEVENT", "VTODO", or "VJOURNAL" calendar components,
      more than one formal category can be specified by using multiple
      CONCEPT properties.

      This categorization is distinct from the more informal "tagging"
      of components provided by the existing CATEGORIES property.  It is
      expected that the value of the CONCEPT property will reference an
      external resource which provides information about the
      categorization.

      In addition, a structured URI value allows for hierarchical
      categorization of events.

      Possible category resources are the various proprietary systems,
      for example Library of Congress, or an open source of
      categorisation data.

   Format Definition:

   This property is defined by the following notation:

     concept        =  "CONCEPT" conceptparam ":"
                           uri CRLF

     conceptparam = *(";" other-param)

   The following is an example of this property.  It points to a server
   acting as the source for the calendar object.

     CONCEPT:http://example.com/event-types/arts/music

8.2.  Link

   Property name:  LINK

   Purpose:  This property provides a reference to external information
      related to a component.

   Value type:  URI, TEXT or REFERENCE

   Property Parameters:  The VALUE parameter is required.  Non-standard,
      reference type or format type parameters can also be specified on
      this property.  The LABEL parameter is defined in [RFC7986]

   Conformance:  This property can be specified zero or more times in
      any iCalendar component.

   Description:  When used in a component the value of this property
      points to additional information related to the component.  For
      example, it may reference the originating web server.

   Format Definition:

   This property is defined by the following notation:

      This property is a serialisation of the model in [RFC8288], where
      the link target is carried in the property value, the link context
      is the containing calendar entity, and the link relation type and
      any target attributes are carried in iCalendar property
      parameters.

      The LINK property parameters map to [RFC8288] attributes as
      follows:

      LABEL:  Maps to the "title" attribute defined in section 3.4.1 of
         [RFC8288].

      LANG:  Maps to the "hreflang" attribute defined in section 3.4.1
         of [RFC8288].

      LINKREL:  Maps to the link relation type defined in section 2.1 of
         [RFC8288].

      FMTTYPE:  Maps to the "type" attribute defined in section 3.4.1 of
         [RFC8288].

      There is no mapping for [RFC8288] "title*", "anchor", "rev" or
      "media".

   Example:

   The following is an example of this property which provides a
   reference to the source for the calendar object.

     LINK;LINKREL=SOURCE;LABEL=Venue;VALUE=URI:http://example.com/events

   Example:

   The following is an example of this property which provides a
   reference to an entity from which this one was derived.  The link
   relation is a vendor defined value

     LINK;LINKREL="https://example.com/linkrel/derivedFrom";VALUE=URI:
      http://example.com/tasks/01234567-abcd1234.ics

   vendor defined value

  LINK;LINKREL="https://example.com/linkrel/costStructure";
   VALUE=REFERENCE:
   http://example.com/xmlDocs/bidFramework.xml
   #xpointer(descendant::CostStruc/range-to(following::CostStrucEND[1]))

8.3.  Refid

   Property name:  REFID

   Purpose:  This property value acts as a key for associated iCalendar
      entities.

   Value type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard parameters can be specified on
      this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified zero or more times in
      any iCalendar component.

   Description:  The value of this property is free-form text that
      creates an identifier for associated components.  All components
      that use the same REFID value are associated through that value
      and can be located or retrieved as a group.  For example, all of
      the events in a travel itinerary would have the same REFID value,
      so as to be grouped together.

   Format Definition:

   This property is defined by the following notation:

     refid      = "REFID" refidparam ":" text CRLF


     refidparam      = *(";" other-param)


      The current link registry

9.  Updates to RFC 5545

   This specification updates the RELATED-TO property defined in
   Section 3.8.4.5 of [RFC5545].

   The RELTYPE parameter is extended to take new values defining
   temporal relationships, a GAP parameter is defined to provide lead
   and lag values, and RELATED-TO is extended to allow URI values.
   These changes allow the RELATED-TO property to define a richer set of
   relationships useful for project management.

9.1.  RELATED-TO

   Property name:  RELATED-TO

   Purpose:  This property is used to represent a relationship or
      reference between one calendar component and another.  The
      definition here extends the definition in Section 3.8.4.5 of
      [RFC5545] by allowing URI or UID values and a GAP parameter.

   Value type:  URI, UID or TEXT

   Property Parameters:  Relationship type, IANA and non-standard
      property parameters can be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property MAY be specified in any iCalendar
      component.

   Description:  By default or when VALUE=UID is specified, the property
      value consists of the persistent, globally unique identifier of
      another calendar component.  This value would be represented in a
      calendar component by the "UID" property.

      By default, the property value points to another calendar
      component that has a PARENT relationship to the referencing
      object.  The "RELTYPE" property parameter is used to either
      explicitly state the default PARENT relationship type to the
      referenced calendar component or to override the default PARENT
      relationship type and specify either a CHILD or SIBLING
      relationship or a temporal relationship.

      The PARENT relationship indicates that the calendar component is a
      subordinate of the referenced calendar component.  The CHILD
      relationship indicates that the calendar component is a superior
      of the referenced calendar component.  The SIBLING relationship
      indicates that the calendar component is a peer of the referenced
      calendar component.

Internet-Draft           iCalendar Relationships            January 2022


      To preserve backwards compatibility the value type MUST be UID
      when the PARENT, SIBLING or CHILD relationships are specified.

      The FINISHTOSTART, FINISHTOFINISH, STARTTOFINISH or STARTTOSTART
      relationships define temporal relationships as specified in the
      reltype parameter definition.

      Changes to a calendar component referenced by this property can
      have an implicit impact on the related calendar component.  For
      example, if a group event changes its start or end date or time,
      then the related, dependent events will need to have their start
      and end dates changed in a corresponding way.  Similarly, if a
      PARENT calendar component is cancelled or deleted, then there is
      an implied impact to the related CHILD calendar components.  This
      property is intended only to provide information on the
      relationship of calendar components.  It is up to the target
      calendar system to maintain any property implications of this
      relationship.

   Format Definition:

   This property is defined by the following notation:

      related    = "RELATED-TO" relparam ":"
                               ( uid /  ; for VALUE=UID
                                 uri /  ; for VALUE=URI
                                 text ) ; for VALUE=TEXT or default
                   CRLF

      relparam   = ; the elements herein may appear in any order,
                   ; and the order is not significant.

10.  Security Considerations

   Applications using the LINK property need to be aware of the risks
   entailed in using the URIs provided as values.  See section 7 of
   [RFC3986] for a discussion of the security considerations relating to
   URIs.

   In particular note section 7.1 "Reliability and Consistency" of
   [RFC3986] which points out the lack of a stability guarantee for
   referenced resources.

   When the value is a REFERENCE type the targeted data is an XML
   document or portion thereof.  Consumers need to be aware of the
   security issues related to XML processing - in particular those
   related to XML entities.  See [RFC4918] - Section 20.6.  Additionally
   note that the reference may be invalid or become so over time.

   The CONCEPT and redefined RELATED-TO property have the same issues in
   that values may be URIs.

11.  IANA Considerations
