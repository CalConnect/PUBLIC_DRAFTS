    <section anchor="_introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<t anchor="_99b259c5-536b-2212-29fb-dfa205a6eb6b">This document specifies extensions to the existing Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification (iCalendar) <xref target="RFC5545" section="" relative=""></xref>, and associated protocols, in order to enhance the structured communication and execution of tasks. The enhancements allow for the communication, time planning and scheduling of tasks by and between automated systems (e.g. in smart power grids, business process management systems) as well as for human centered tasks.</t>

<t anchor="_baa80340-ea14-cdb7-ec37-8a9dad6e962b">A "task" is a representation of an item of work assigned to an individual or organization. In the iCalendar Object Model <xref target="RFC5545" section="" relative=""></xref> the representation of tasks is by "VTODO" calendar components. Tasks can be identified in a number of situations, either informally as ad-hoc tasks in personal "to-do" lists or more formally in:</t>

<ul anchor="_fedeab92-79ed-5fd1-db47-459b880d1438"><li>Business processes - ranging from repetitive workflows to adaptive cases and trouble ticketing</li>
<li>Project Management - whether for large scale construction projects or collaborative software development</li>
</ul>

<t anchor="_d48beb4e-e863-5ddc-c985-8f62b15497f4">The extensions specified here are defined in the context of an overall architecture for task calendaring and scheduling.</t>

<section anchor="conventions"><name>Terms and Definitions</name>

<t anchor="_8af4a11e-dd92-fbf3-c566-f0a0af0901a4">The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
"SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
"NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119" section="" relative=""></xref> <xref target="RFC8174" section="" relative=""></xref> when, and
only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

<t anchor="_dc6ff448-96b2-dea2-16f1-9bf4ea3c455d">Calendaring and scheduling roles are referred to in quoted-strings of
text with the first character of each word in upper case.  For
example, "Organizer" refers to a role of a "Calendar User" (CU)
within the scheduling protocol.</t>

<t anchor="_6fd93b57-3ed0-ff6e-fb4e-bd8ed95d4106">Calendar components defined by <xref target="RFC5545" section="" relative=""></xref> are referred to with
capitalized, quoted-strings of text.  All calendar components start
with the letter "V".  For example, "VEVENT" refers to the event
calendar component, "VTODO" refers to the to-do calendar component,
and "VJOURNAL" refers to the daily journal calendar component.</t>

<t anchor="_55a38d91-f010-e0c0-ad53-0c0db51760e8">Scheduling methods are referred to with capitalized, quoted-strings
of text.  For example, "REQUEST" refers to the method for requesting
a scheduling calendar component be created or modified; "REPLY"
refers to the method a recipient of a request uses to update their
status with the "Organizer" of the calendar component.</t>

<t anchor="_a2f095b5-1fe8-1f7e-e12e-b1171e2a2d3a">Properties defined by [RFC5545] are referred to with capitalized,
quoted-strings of text, followed by the word "property".  For
example, "ATTENDEE" property refers to the iCalendar property used to
convey the calendar address of a "Calendar User".</t>

<t anchor="_62f9ccbc-ff43-0ef9-5a9d-1e37041ab2b2">Property parameters defined by this specification are referred to
with capitalized, quoted-strings of text, followed by the word
"parameter".  For example, "VALUE" parameter refers to the iCalendar
property parameter used to override the default data type for a
property value.</t>

<t anchor="_5a24a7ef-730f-7664-0c39-dd7b5e1e7fb0">Enumerated values defined by this specification are referred to with
capitalized text, either alone or followed by the word "value".</t>

<t anchor="_c3ba044b-d10b-2b99-70f6-7c7bd74501ff">In tables, the quoted-string text is specified without quotes in
order to minimize the table length.</t>

    <section anchor="architecture"><name>Task Architecture</name>

<t anchor="_4477d929-fe56-7c5b-eeea-d6764f7a28f2">A reference architecture for task calendaring and
scheduling is defined in order to identify the key
logical elements involved in task management and the
interfaces between them to enable interoperability.
The logical elements identified here establish an
appropriate separation of concerns and clarify the
responsibilities of different elements. However, the
architecture does not prescribe a binding or packaging
of elements, i.e., software systems may be developed
where some elements are tightly bound and the interfaces
between bound elements are not exposed. The task
architecture is also described in <xref target="TARCH" section="" relative=""></xref>.</t>

<t anchor="_b165eb21-77e0-4527-2f36-81cf5ae5ca66">The following logical elements form the task architecture that this specification is based on:</t>

<dl anchor="_ca7ecfcd-6944-6358-9eeb-45c519cdae50"><dt>Task Actors</dt><dd><t anchor="_842263d2-24a4-7629-1ff0-7b94598e6769">Various calendar users that may be involved in the monitoring or performing of a task. The set of actors includes: Organizers, Observers, Resources, Assignees, and Candidates.</t>
</dd><dt>Task Organizer</dt><dd><t anchor="_4a4e63c7-022b-4ec3-fce5-d7470b4e094f">The Organizer of a task.</t>
</dd><dt>Task Domain Data</dt><dd><t anchor="_fa8a2ff7-f95b-5a3e-9b76-4a7c9e27ab1d">This is any domain specific data that may be acted on or provides context to it in performing a task.</t>
</dd><dt>Task Specific Application</dt><dd><t anchor="_00edaaae-e3fc-5fb7-4c32-546561e88994">A task specific application renders the data concerning the task (including task domain data) for presentation and manipulation by a task actor.</t>
</dd><dt>Process Logic</dt><dd><t anchor="_f62a916c-568f-fafc-d1c3-2e72599f6c2a">Determines under what conditions a task (or tasks) is generated and the actions to take on completion, or some other status event occurring (or not) on the task.</t>
</dd><dt>Task Trigger</dt><dd><t anchor="_a0df3f23-d7cd-6ea0-2935-bd222e1a8351">This is some event that gives rise to the generation
of a task according to Process Logic. Task triggers can come from
many sources including, for example; a task being requested through
the calendaring system, a status change in the progression of a
business process being managed by a business process management or
Enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.</t>
</dd><dt>Task Assignment Rules</dt><dd><t anchor="_80be3fa0-12ec-6441-3671-303afebfbe17">Govern how actors are assigned to a task.
A range of different assignment patterns <xref target="WfRP" section="" relative=""></xref> may be considered,
including the two general cases:</t>
<ol anchor="_e07c5881-b03b-0e3b-82b1-cca2a7a2520f" type="a"><li>Delegation to a named actor or group of actors</li>
<li>Advertising to a pool of actors for self-selection</li>
</ol>

<t anchor="_7a6fdee0-5a9b-8b10-6325-59709f440a13">In either case the assignment may be made based on a variety of criteria
including, name, availability, skills, capacity, etc.</t>
</dd><dt>Task Generating System</dt><dd><t anchor="_e3f7bcf8-db9a-8358-a7e3-f8c6ed2d7478">A system that creates and assigns tasks in response to some initiating event (task trigger). Task creation is according to Process Logic with task assignment determined by Task Assignment Rules. This system also tracks the status of tasks and will initiate further actions based upon the status. A task generating system can take many forms, for example; Business Process Management System, Project Management System, Bug Tracking System, Building Control System. A Task Generating System may also be a human. In iCalendar terms the Task Generating System is the organizer.</t>
</dd><dt>Human Task Generation</dt><dd><t anchor="_a5163aa8-ea37-9770-c383-df73089ebed4">Task creation, assignment and tracking coordinated by a human organizer is a special case of a task generating system. In this case Task Assignment Rules and Process Logic may be either explicit or tacit.</t>
</dd><dt>Directory Service</dt><dd><t anchor="_0d1abacc-bcae-b104-cf96-dd0a58cb1f56">A software system that stores and provides access to information providing details of task actors that may participate or be interested in a task.</t>
</dd><dt>Calendar and Scheduling System</dt><dd><t anchor="_bfd06749-06a6-7463-3832-fdb0fd4402d1">A software system that stores, publishes and synchronizes calendar data such as events, tasks and journal entries for actors. In the context of tasks this includes schedules (i.e. allocated time and availability to perform tasks) and task lists. A calendar and scheduling system typically consists of server and client software components.</t>
</dd></dl>

<t anchor="_6d340dc2-3a37-9f0f-012c-05d1ea6f9082">It is not within the scope of this document to specify how Process Logic or Task Assignment Rules are codified. Such logic and rules may be codified in a variety of ways, including traditional programming languages (e.g. C++, Java) or process modelling languages (e.g. BPMN <xref target="BPMN" section="" relative=""></xref>).</t>

    <section anchor="architecture-foundations"><name>Architecture Foundations</name>

<t anchor="_8b46f0d9-3cfa-9892-67fb-de52054ed227">The key standards that enable interoperability between the logical elements of the architecture are the Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification (iCalendar) <xref target="RFC5545" section="" relative=""></xref> and associated protocols. Task and task status are represented by the iCalendar "VTODO" component. Protocols include, in particular, the iCalendar Transport-Independent Interoperability Protocol (iTIP) <xref target="RFC5546" section="" relative=""></xref> for task assignment and scheduling, and Calendaring Extensions to WebDAV (CalDAV) <xref target="RFC4791" section="" relative=""></xref> for client server communication.</t>

<t anchor="_0b7f296b-9ba2-f3b8-0768-27b085a4e160">Additionally, this specification uses definitions from
Support for iCalendar Relationships <xref target="RFC9253" section="" relative=""></xref>. The LINK, REFID, RELATED-TO and CONCEPT properties enable context and a rich set of relationships between tasks and other iCalendar components to be specified.</t>

<t anchor="_8e268123-e5de-427e-1895-9c5af89c8e93">In order to support the task architecture described in <xref target="architecture"></xref>, this document defines a number of extensions to the current iCalendar standards in the areas of:</t>

<section anchor="_deadlines"><name>Deadlines</name>

<t anchor="_2a97d438-7071-4e26-7f82-5f1164cff1ea">Deadlines for starting and finishing a task are defined
by the DTSTART, DUE and DURATION properties. DTSTART
represents the earliest start time for beginning work
on a task. DUE, or DTSTART + DURATION represent the
latest finish time for a task. Thus, these properties
define a "window" within which a task has to be
performed. However, there is currently no way to
indicate how long the task is expected to take. This
document defines a new property, in <xref target="prop-estimated-duration"></xref> ESTIMATED-DURATION, to
allow the estimated time that a task should take to be
specified separately from the deadlines for starting
and finishing a task. This supports time planning by
enabling calendar user agents to display when tasks
should occur and therefore allow calendar users to
visualize when tasks should be performed and allocate
time to them.</t>

without it being completed. TASK-MODE processing is performed on the organizer's copy of the task.</t>

<t anchor="_af710561-e720-81cb-9069-2c2e67257f6c">The CalDAV <xref target="RFC4791" section="" relative=""></xref> calendar access protocol allows clients and servers to exchange iCalendar data. With the introduction of the "TASK-MODE" property in this specification, different automated task management behaviours may be delegated to the server by the Task Organizer depending upon the value of "TASK-MODE".</t>

<t anchor="_81045c8e-8478-2d32-05fd-a1e8e2d64741">In order for a CalDAV client to know what task modes are available, a CalDAV server advertises a CALDAV:supported-task-mode-set WebDAV property on calendar home or calendar collections if it supports the use of the "TASK-MODE" property as described in this specification.  The server can advertise a specific set of supported task modes by including one or more CALDAV:supported-task-mode XML elements within the CALDAV:supported-task-mode-set XML element. If no CALDAV:supported-task-mode XML elements are included in the WebDAV property, then clients can try any task mode, but need to be prepared for a failure when attempting to store the calendar data.</t>

<t anchor="_600a310f-4c7f-912f-9ef9-2add9c463918">Clients MUST NOT attempt to store iCalendar data containing "TASK-MODE" elements if the CALDAV:supported-task-mode-set WebDAV property is not advertised by the server.</t>

<t anchor="_8d1f990e-ac9f-6d37-0ae6-64da689ed35a">The server SHOULD return an HTTP 403 response with a DAV:error element containing a CALDAV:supported-task-mode XML element, if a client attempts to store iCalendar data with an "TASK-MODE" element value not supported by the server.</t>

<t anchor="_44074c20-c746-ac59-47d3-c091bdf3c336">It is possible for a "TASK-MODE" value to be present in calendar data on the server being accessed by a client that does not support the "TASK-MODE" property. It is expected that existing clients, unaware of "TASK-MODE", will fail gracefully by ignoring the calendar property.</t>
