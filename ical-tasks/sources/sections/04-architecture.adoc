=== Task Architecture
A reference architecture for task calendaring and scheduling is defined in order to identify the key logical elements involved in task management and the interfaces between them to enable interoperability. The logical elements identified here establish an appropriate separation of concerns and clarify the responsibilities of different elements. However, the architecture does not prescribe a binding or packaging of elements, i.e., software systems may be developed where some elements are tightly bound and the interfaces between bound elements are not exposed. The task architecture is also described in <<TARCH>>.
