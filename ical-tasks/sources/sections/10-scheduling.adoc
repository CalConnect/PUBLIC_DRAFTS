== Task Scheduling and Assignment

Tasks are assigned to actors using one or more <<RFC5545>> "ATTENDEE"
properties and/or one or more <<RFC9073>> "PARTICIPANT" calendar components.

Communication of task assignment or delegation to one or more actors who are
allocated to a task by the organizer is directly supported by iTIP, i.e., all
included "ATTENDEE" properties in an iTIP REQUEST are expected to perform the task.

The offering or advertising of a task to one or more (potential) actors where
only one or a subset of the candidates may accept the task will be addressed
by a later specification.
