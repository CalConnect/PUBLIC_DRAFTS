=== Task Scheduling and Assignment

This specification supports the two distinct models of assigning actors to tasks, i.e., 1) strictly one assignee per task or 2) task assignment to multiple assignees. In this regard one or many ATTENDEES may be specified against a task depending upon the model applied by the task organizer.

In addition a number of different patterns of resource or assignee identification are anticipated. The specific Task Assignment Rules are the responsibility of the Task Organizer.

Communication of task assignment or delegation to one or more actors who are allocated to a task by the organizer is directly supported by iTIP, i.e., all included ATTENDEES in an iTIP REQUEST are expected to perform the task.

The offering or advertising of a task to one or more (potential) actors where only one or a subset of the candidates may accept the task will be addressed by a new VPOLL mode (See Appendix B) [VPOLL].
