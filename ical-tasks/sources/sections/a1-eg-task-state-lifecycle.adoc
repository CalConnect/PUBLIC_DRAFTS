== Examples of Task State Lifecycle

=== Simple Case Status Change

// Example of status changes in assigning and performing a task with one attendee.

[cols="1,3,3,10",options=header]
[frame="topbot",grid="none",alt="Example of status changes in assigning and performing a task with one attendee.", summary="Example of status changes in assigning and performing a task with one attendee."]
|===
|  | STATUS   | PARTSTAT  | Action
| 1 | - |  - | Organizer draft
| 2 | NEEDS-ACTION  | NEEDS-ACTION  | Organizer sends iTIP request
| 3 | NEEDS-ACTION  | ACCEPTED        | Attendee reply
| 4 | PENDING       | ACCEPTED        | Task accepted but waiting on some "trigger" to start (e.g. another task has to finish first)
| 5 | IN-PROCESS    | IN-PROCESS      | Attendee reply now working on the task
| 6 | IN-PROCESS    | COMPLETED       | Attendee reply completed
| 7 | COMPLETED     | COMPLETED       | Organizer changes overall state

=== Example for multiple Attendees

Example of status changes in assigning and performing a task with two attendees (A1 and A2).

[cols="1,3,3,3,10",options=header]
[frame="topbot",grid="none"]
|===
| | STATUS | PARTSTAT (A1) | PARTSTAT (A2) | Action
| 1 | - |  -  | - | Organizer draft.
| 2 | NEEDS-ACTION | NEEDS-ACTION  | NEEDS-ACTION | Organizer sends iTIP request.
| 4 | NEEDS-ACTION  |  ACCEPTED   |     NEEDS-ACTION | Attendee 1 reply.
| 5 | NEEDS-ACTION  | ACCEPTED      |  ACCEPTED  | Attendee 2 reply.
| 6 |  PENDING  |  ACCEPTED      |  ACCEPTED    | Task accepted but waiting on some"trigger" to start (e.g. another task has to finish first)
| 7 | IN-PROCESS |  ACCEPTED   |     IN-PROCESS | Attendee 2 reply now working on the task.
| 8 | IN-PROCESS |  IN-PROCESS |     IN-PROCESS| Attendee 1 reply now working on the task.
| 9 | IN-PROCESS    |  COMPLETED  |     IN-PROCESS| Attendee 1 reply Completed (overall status still IN-PROCESS).
| 10 | IN-PROCESS    |  COMPLETED     |  COMPLETED | Attendee 2 reply Completed
| 11 |  COMPLETED     |  COMPLETED     |  COMPLETED | Organizer changes overall state once both attendees are finished.

Note: The logic for determining the status change to the VTODO is determined by the task organizer based on the ATTENDEE status and other business logic.
