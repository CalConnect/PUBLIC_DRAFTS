== Abstract
The Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification (iCalendar) (RFC5545) VTODO calendar component has been seen
as the poor relation of VEVENT - useful only for personal reminders and to-do lists.

This document updates and defines extensions to VTODO
to provide improved status tracking, scheduling and specification of tasks to allow its use in other contexts, such as process control and project management.

It also defines how Calendaring Extensions to
WebDAV (CalDAV) (RFC 4791) servers can be extended to
support certain automated task management behaviours.
