== Task Extensions

In order to support the task architecture described in <<architecture>>, this document defines a number of extensions to the current iCalendar standards in the areas of:

Task Specification:: improved ability to specify domain specific tasks

Task Deadlines, Milestones and Time Planning:: clarification of deadlines and extension for task duration to support task time planning

Task Scheduling and Assignment:: ensure support for common patterns of scheduling and assigning tasks

Task Status Tracking:: improved granularity in status tracking information and alerting task actors of pending or actual task status changes

These extensions are supported mainly by additions to the properties and parameters used within the "VTODO" calendar component.
