== Architecture Foundations

The key standards that enable interoperability between the logical elements of the
architecture are the Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification (iCalendar) <<RFC5545>>
and associated protocols. Task and task status are represented by the iCalendar "VTODO" calendar component. Protocols include, in particular, the iCalendar Transport-Independent Interoperability Protocol (iTIP) <<RFC5546>> for task assignment and scheduling, and Calendaring Extensions to WebDAV (CalDAV) <<RFC4791>> for client server communication.

Additionally, this specification uses definitions from
Support for iCalendar Relationships <<RFC9253>>. The LINK, REFID, RELATED-TO and CONCEPT properties enable context and a rich set of relationships between tasks and other iCalendar components to be specified.
