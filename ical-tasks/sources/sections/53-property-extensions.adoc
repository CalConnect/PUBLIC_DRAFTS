=== Redefined STATUS Property

The Status property is defined in <<RFC5545, section=3.8.1.11>>. This
specification extends that property to include new values
associated with VTODO iCalendar components (See Appendix A for
examples of the task state lifecycle).

Format Definition:: The "STATUS" property parameter list is augmented
as follows:

[source,bnf]
----

statvalue-todo = / "PENDING"    ;Indicates a to-do has been
                ;created and accepted, but has not
                ;yet started.
                / "FAILED"       ;Indicates to-do has failed.
                ;Extended status values for
                ;"VTODO".
----

Description:

PENDING - A task has been created but has not yet started and is ready
to start subject to other dependencies (e.g. preceding task or
DTSTART). This is the default state.

FAILED - task has failed and may need some follow-up from the
organizer to re-schedule or cancel

Example: The following is an example of this property for a "VTODO"
calendar component:
