          JSContact: A JSON representation of addressbook data
                      draft-stepanek-jscontact-01

Abstract

   This specification defines a data model and JSON representation of
   contact information that can be used for data storage and exchange in
   address book or directory applications.  It aims to be an alternative
   to the vCard data format and to be unambiguous, extendable and simple
   to process.  In contrast to the JSON-based jCard format, it is not a
   direct mapping from the vCard data model and expands semantics where
   appropriate.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a data model for contact data normally used in
   address book or directory applications and services.  It aims to be
   an alternative to the vCard data format [RFC6350] and to provide a
   JSON-based standard representation of contacts data.

   The key design considerations for this data model are as follows:

   o  Most of the initial set of attributes should be taken from the
      vCard data format [RFC6350], but the specification should add new
      attributes or value types, or not support existing ones, where
      appropriate.  Conversion between the data formats need not fully
      preserve semantic meaning.

   o  The attributes of the contacts data represented must be described
      as a simple key-value pair, reducing complexity of its
      representation.

   o  The data model should avoid all ambiguities and make it difficult
      to make mistakes during implementation.

   o  Extensions, such as new properties and components, MUST NOT lead
      to requiring an update to this document.

   The representation of this data model is defined in the I-JSON format
   [RFC7493], which is a strict subset of the JavaScript Object Notation
   (JSON) Data Interchange Format [RFC8259].  Using JSON is mostly a
   pragmatic choice: its widespread use makes JSContact easier to adopt,
   and the availability of production-ready JSON implementations

   eliminates a whole category of parser-related interoperability
   issues.

1.1.  Relation to the xCard and jCard formats

   The xCard [RFC6351] and jCard [RFC7095] specifications define
   alternative representations for vCard data, in XML and JSON format
   respectively.  Both explicitly aim to not change the underlying data
   model.  Accordingly, they are regarded as equal to vCard in the
   context of this document.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Contact

   MIME type: "application/jscontact+json;type=jscontact"

   A JSContact object stores contact information about a person,
   organization or company.  It has the following properties:

   o  uid: String (mandatory).  A globally unique identifier, used to
      associate the object as the same across different systems,
      addressbooks and views.  The value of this property MUST be unique
      across _all_ JSContact objects.  [RFC4122] describes a range of
      established algorithms to generate universally unique identifiers
      (UUID), and the random or pseudo-random version is recommended.
      For compatibility with [RFC6350] UIDs, implementations MUST accept
      both URI and free-form text.

   o  kind: String (optional).  The kind of the entity the Contact
      represents.  The value MUST be either one of the following values,
      registered in a future RFC, or a vendor-specific value:

      *  "individual": a single person

      *  "org": an organization

      *  "location": a named location

   o  fullName: String (mandatory) The full name(s) of a contact (e.g.
      the personal name and surname of an individual, the name of an
      organization).

      the list names the organization, and any following entries name

      of the contact.

   o  role: String (optional).  The role, function or part played in a
      particular situation by the contact.  In contrast to a job title,
      the role might differ for example in project contexts.

   o  emails: ContactInformation[] (optional).  An array of
      ContactInformation objects where the values are email addresses.
      Types are:

      *  "personal" The address is for emailing the contact in a
         personal context.

      *  "work" The address is for emailing the contact in a
         professional context.

      information:

      *  "private" The phone number should be used in a private context.

   A ContactInformation object has the following properties:

   o  type: String (mandatory).  Specifies the context of the contact
      information.  This MUST be taken from the set of values allowed
      depending on whether this is part of the phones, emails or online
      property (see above).

   o  label: String (optional).  A label describing the value in more
      detail, especially if the type property has value "other" (but MAY
      be included with any type).

   o  value: String (mandatory).  The actual contact information, e.g.
      the email address or phone number.

   o  isPreferred: Boolean (optional, default: "false").  Whether this
      ContactInformation is the preferred for its type.  This SHOULD
      only be one per type.

   An Address object has the following properties:

   o  type: String (mandatory).  Specifies the context of the address
      information.  The value MUST be either one of the following
      values, registered in a future RFC, or a vendor-specific value:

      *  "home" An address of a residence associated with the contact.

      *  "work" An address of a workplace associated with the contact.

      *  "billing" An address to be used with billing associated with

   o  label: String (optional).  A label describing the value in more
      detail.

   o  fullAddress: String (optional).  The complete address, excluding
      type and label.  This property is mainly useful to represent
      addresses of which the individual address components are unknown.

   o  street: String (optional).  The street address.  This MAY be
      multiple lines; newlines MUST be preserved.

   o  locality: String (optional).  The city, town, village, post town,

      is located in.  This SHOULD be a time zone name registered in the
      IANA Time Zone Database [1].  Unknown time zone identifiers MAY be
      ignored by implementations.

   o  isPreferred: Boolean (optional, default: "false").  Whether this
      Address is the preferred for its type.  This SHOULD only be one
      per type.

3.  Contact Group

   MIME type: "application/jscontact+json;type=jscontactgroup"

   A JSContactGroup object represents a named set of contacts.  It has
   the following properties:

      requirements as for the JSContact uid property apply.

   o  name: String (optional).  The user-visible name for the group,
      e.g.  "Friends".  This may be any UTF-8 string of at least 1
