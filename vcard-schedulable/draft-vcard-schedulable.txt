1.  Introduction

   The schedulable object class defines a number of properties which are
   required or useful for schedulable entities.

   A schedulable entity may be scheduled for meetings (usually a person)
   or for use (usually a resource).  The properties specified here allow
   a client to discover such an entity and initiate a scheduling
   request.

   Some of the properties and values may be used by calendar servers to
   determine the appropriate action when a scheduling request is
   received.  For example, do we auto-accept the request if the entity
   is available?

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Schedulable Objectclass Value

   This specification defines a new value for the OBJECTCLASS property
   deined in [TODO].  The value is registered according to the procedure
   in Section 10.2.6 of [RFC6350].

   Value:  schedulable

   Purpose:  To specify the entity with this objectclass is schedulable.

   Conformance  This value MAY be used with the OBJECTCLASS property.
      If used the properties, parameters and values of the vcard MUST
      conform to the requirements of this specification.

   Example:  OBJECTCLASS:schedulable

4.  Current vCard Properties for use with OBJECTCLASS:schedulable.

   The following properties MUST be specified in a vCard representing a
   calendaring or schedulable resource:

   o  FN

   o  UID

   The following properties SHOULD be specified in a vCard representing
   a calendaring or schedulable resource:

   o  KIND

   o  CALADRURI or EMAIL

4.1.  CALADRURI

   The CALADRURI value is the address that would be used by a Scheduling
   and Calendaring application to schedule the resource.

   Its value MUST be a uri string, in most cases a mailto: uri.  The
   EMAIL property value of the resource should be used for scheduling,
   in the absence of this property.

5.  New vCard Properties for use with OBJECTCLASS:schedulable.

   The following new properties MAY be used with
   OBJECTCLASS:schedulable.

   Format and cardinality of new vCard properties are defined as
   described in Section 3.3 of [RFC6350].

5.1.  AUTOSCHEDULE

   Purpose:  Specify if the resource is automatically scheduled with no
      approval process.

   ValueType:  Text value from the auto schedule values table.

   Cardinality:  *1

   ABNF:

     AUTOSCHEDULE-param = "VALUE=text" / any-param
     AUTOSCHEDULE-value = text

   Default value:  If the property is absent or unknown, resource
      bookings are auto accepted, if it does not result in a booking
      conflict and auto declined if it does.

   Default value:  AUTO

   Example value:  AUTO

                        Auto Schedule Values Table:

5.2.  BOOKINGINFO

   Purpose:  Provide the complete information on scheduling a resource
      if access rights are set or approval is required.

   ValueType:  URI value.  It MAY also be a free-form text value.

   Cardinality:  *

   ABNF:

     BOOKINGINFO-param = "VALUE=" ("text" / "uri") /
                          any-param
     BOOKINGINFO-value = uri / text

   Default value:  None

   Example value:  http://www.example.com/room1_booking.html

5.3.  BOOKINGRESTRICTED

   Purpose:  Specify if there are restrictions to booking the resource
      specified by access rights in the system.  More information is
      provided by the BOOKINGINFO Section 5.2 property.

   ValueType:  Boolean value.

   Cardinality:  *1

   ABNF:

     BOOKINGRESTRICTED-param = "VALUE=boolean" / any-param
     BOOKINGRESTRICTED-value = boolean

   Default value:  FALSE.

      Absence of this property indicates no restriction to booking the
      resource.

   Example value:  TRUE

5.4.  BOOKINGWINDOWSTART

   Purpose:  Defines how much time in advance the resource can be
      booked.

   ValueType:  Duration value.

      The format is based on the [ISO.8601.2004] duration representation
      basic format with designators for the duration of time.  The
      format can represent nominal durations (weeks and days) and
      accurate durations (hours, minutes, and seconds).  The syntax is
      further defined in Appendix A, "Duration" section of [RFC3339].

   Cardinality:
      *1

   ABNF:

     BOOKINGWINDOWSTART-param = "VALUE=text" / any-param
     BOOKINGWINDOWSTART-value = text

   Special Notes:  The value of this property is used to calculate the
      earliest date and time when a resource can be reserved for an
      event starting on a specific date and time.

      If this property value is defined, the resource may be booked for
      an event at a certain time, only if the current time is equal to
      or after the date and time calculated by subtracting this value
      from the event's proposed start time.  If this property is absent,
      then the resource may be booked at any time before the end of the
      booking window.

   Default value:  None

   Example value:  P3M

5.5.  BOOKINGWINDOWEND

   Purpose:  Defines how much time in advance the resource booking is
      closed.

   ValueType:  Duration value.

      The format is based on the [ISO.8601.2004] duration representation
      basic format with designators for the duration of time.  The
      format can represent nominal durations (weeks and days) and
      accurate durations (hours, minutes, and seconds).  The syntax is
      further defined in Appendix A, "Duration" section of [RFC3339].

   Cardinality:  *1

   ABNF:

     BOOKINGWINDOWEND-param = "VALUE=text" / any-param
     BOOKINGWINDOWEND-value = text

Internet-Draft      Schedulable Objectclass for vCard       January 2013


   Special Notes:
      The value of this property is used to calculate the latest date
      and time when a resource can be reserved for an event starting on
      a specific date and time.
      If the current time is equal to or before the value obtained by
      subtracting BookingWindowEnd from the start date and time of the
      event, then the resource may be booked.  If this property is
      absent, then the resource may be booked anytime from booking
      window start to the start of the event.
      BookingWindow Start and End together provide the window of time a
      resource can be booked, relative to the start time of the event.


                 If: BookingWindowStart = BwS,
                     BookingWindowEnd = BwE,
                     Current Time = CT and
                     Event Start Time = ST,
                 Then a resource can be booked at a certain time only if
                     CT is equal to or after (ST - BwS)
                     and CT is equal to or before (ST - BwE)

   Default value:
      None

   Example value:
      P5D

5.6.  MAXINSTANCES

   Purpose:  Maximum number of instances of an event, the resource can
      be scheduled for from NOW.

   ValueType:  Integer value.

   Cardinality:  *1

   ABNF:

     MAXINSTANCES-param = "VALUE=integer" / any-param
     MAXINSTANCES-value = integer

   Special Notes:  Value of 0 indicates no limits.  Value of 1 indicates
      that no recurring bookings are allowed.  If this property is
      absent there is no limit to the number of instances it may be
      booked for at any moment.

   Default value:  0

Internet-Draft      Schedulable Objectclass for vCard       January 2013


   Example value:  60

5.7.  MULTIBOOK

   Purpose:  Number of simultaneous bookings allowed.

   ValueType:  Integer value.
      Value of 0 indicates no limits.

   Cardinality:  *1

   ABNF:

     MULTIBOOK-param = "VALUE=integer" / any-param
     MULTIBOOK-value = integer

   Special Notes:  Value of 0 indicates no limits.  If this property is
      absent the resource may be booked only for one event at a
      particular moment.

   Default value:  1

   Example value:  1

6.  New Parameter Values

6.1.  RELATED TYPE Values

   This document specifies the following additional values that can be
   used as the value for the TYPE parameter of the RELATED property
   defined in Section 6.6.6 of [RFC6350].

   o  schedule-admin: an entity that performs scheduling approval, when
      scheduling the entity associated with this vCard, if approval
      required.

7.  Examples

7.1.  Schedulable

   A schedulable entity can be scheduled for meetings (as a person) or
   for use (as a resource).  For a scheduling system to be able to
   usefully manage the schedule it needs specific information.

   At the very least there MUST be some form of calendar user address.
   It's useful to know whether requests can be auto accepted if the slot
   is available.

8.  Security Considerations

   As this document only defines schema for representing entities for
   calendaring and scheduling and does not refer to the actual storage
   mechanism itself, or the calendaring and scheduling protocol, no
   special security considerations are required as part of this
   document.

10.  Acknowledgments

   This specification is a result of discussions that took place within
   the Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium's Resource Technical
   Committee.  The authors thank the participants of that group.

11.  Recommendations for Calendaring Systems

   While this document does not mandate how each of the defined property
   values must be used by calendaring systems, here are some
   recommendations:

   1.  BOOKINGWINDOWSTART (Section 5.4), BOOKINGWINDOWEND (Section 5.5)
       and MULTIBOOK (Section 5.7) information should be used in
       freebusy calculations.  A query for a time slot that falls
       outside the booking window or one that already has the maximum
       allowed number of simultaneous bookings, MUST be returned as
       BUSY_UNAVAILABLE.

   2.  Calendaring systems that support the AUTOSCHEDULE ()Section 5.1)
       property, SHOULD automatically mark the attendee PARTSTAT for a
       resource as ACCEPTED, if its auto schedule value is AUTO and the
       scheduling is successful.  If scheduling administrator approval
       is required, the PARTSTAT could be automatically marked as
       TENTATIVE.  Rooms SHOULD have this property defined.

   3.  Information from other properties, for example the capacity if a
       resource can be used by calendaring systems to warn end users if
       the number of attendees exceed the capacity value.  Rooms SHOULD
       have CAPACITY defined.

   Individual calendar servers may regard the values of these properties
   set in a directory server or a different database as advisory and
   could further limit what it allows.
