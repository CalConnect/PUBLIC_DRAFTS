Internet-Draft        iCalendar VINSTANCE Component         October 2016


1.  Introduction

   The iCalendar [RFC5545] data format is in widespread use to represent
   calendar data. iCalendar has a data model that supports the concept
   of recurring, or repeating, events (or other types of objects such as
   tasks).  With repeating events, it is often the case that one
   particular instance may differ from the rest.  In that case iCalendar
   requires that all the data for that event be included, even though
   only a small portion of it may be different.  For long lived
   recurring events with lots of attendees present, this can often
   result in a significant increase in the size of the iCalendar data as
   many instances get overridden.

   This specification updates the iCalendar data model to support a new
   iCalendar component that can be used to represent just the changes in
   an overridden instance, rather than having to include everything
   describing it.  This can significantly reduce the size of the
   iCalendar data, leading to reductions in network I/O (with resultant
   savings in battery usage on mobile devices), and storage
   requirements, on clients, servers, and associated databases.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   The notation used in this memo is the ABNF notation of [RFC5234] as
   used by iCalendar [RFC5545].  Any syntax elements shown below that
   are not explicitly defined in this specification come from iCalendar
   [RFC5545], CalDAV [RFC4791], and [draft-patch].

3.  Overview

   Recurring events (or other types of component) in iCalendar are
   defined by the presence of "RRULE", "RDATE", and "EXDATE" properties
   in a "master component".  Those rules produce a set of "generated
   instances".  "Generated instances" do not need to have a
   representation in the iCalendar data, as their content can be
   inferred from the "master component".  In some cases specific
   "generated instances" are changed, resulting in an "overridden
   instance".  An "overridden instance" is represented in iCalendar as
   an "overridden component", which has the same "UID" property value as
   the "master component", and a "RECURRENCE-ID" property whose value
   matches the start time of the corresponding "generated instance"
   (which can be different from the actual start time of the "overridden
   instance").

Internet-Draft        iCalendar VINSTANCE Component         October 2016


   For example, consider the following daily recurring event, with no
   overridden instances.  This event defines a set of generated
   instances for 20160902, 20160903, 20160904, etc.

     BEGIN:VCALENDAR
     PRODID:test
     VERSION:2.0
     BEGIN:VEVENT
     UID:1234
     DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20160902
     DURATION:PT1H
     SUMMARY:Master component
     LOCATION:My office
     RRULE:FREQ=DAILY
     END:VEVENT
     END:VCALENDAR

   If the summary of the second instance needs to be changed, the
   resulting iCalendar object would be:

     BEGIN:VCALENDAR
     PRODID:test
     VERSION:2.0
     BEGIN:VEVENT
     UID:1234
     DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20160902
     DURATION:PT1H
     SUMMARY:Master component
     LOCATION:My office
     RRULE:FREQ=DAILY
     END:VEVENT
   / BEGIN:VEVENT
   | UID:1234
   | RECURRENCE-ID;VALUE=DATE:20160903
   | DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20160903
   | DURATION:PT1H
   | SUMMARY:Override second instance
   | LOCATION:My office
   \ END:VEVENT
     END:VCALENDAR

   As can be seen, the highlighted overridden component for 20160903
   duplicates many iCalendar properties from the master component, with
   the "SUMMARY" property being different, "RECURRENCE-ID" added, and
   "DTSTART" adjusted to the start time of the instance.  All the other
   properties are the same as the corresponding ones in the master
   component.  Using the new representation described by this
   specification, this iCalendar object would appear as:

Internet-Draft        iCalendar VINSTANCE Component         October 2016


     BEGIN:VCALENDAR
     PRODID:test
     VERSION:2.0
     BEGIN:VEVENT
     UID:1234
     DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20160902
     DURATION:PT1H
     SUMMARY:Master component
     LOCATION:My office
     RRULE:FREQ=DAILY
   / BEGIN:VINSTANCE
   | RECURRENCE-ID;VALUE=DATE:20160903
   | SUMMARY:Override second instance
   \ END:VINSTANCE
     END:VEVENT
     END:VCALENDAR

   In this case the highlighted "VINSTANCE" component is used to
   encapsulate just those iCalendar properties that are different from
   the generated instance - just "SUMMARY" in this case.  The new
   representation is just over 80% of the size of the traditional
   representation, giving a small, but not insignificant, reduction in
   size.  But as more overrides are needed, or as more properties are
   added to the master component, the savings will increase
   dramatically.

4.  VINSTANCE Component

   This specification defines the new "VINSTANCE" component, which is
   used to represent just the differences between a generated instance,
   derived from the master component, and the actual overridden instance
   that will be used instead of the generated instance.

   "VINSTANCE" components MUST only appear as sub-components within
   master components (e.g., they can only appear as sub-components of
   components that include at least one of either "RRULE" or "RDATE"
   properties).

   Each "VINSTANCE" component MUST include a "RECURRENCE-ID" property
   with a value that identifies the instance being overridden.  Multiple
   "VINSTANCE" components can appear within a single master component,
   but each MUST have a unique "RECURRENCE-ID" property value.  Unlike
   traditional overridden components, "VINSTANCE" components MUST NOT
   include a "UID" property (the effective "UID" is that of the master
   component enclosing the "VINSTANCE" component).

   The iCalendar components and properties within a "VINSTANCE"
   component are interpreted as follows:



Daboo                      Expires May 1, 2017                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft        iCalendar VINSTANCE Component         October 2016


   1.  Any component appearing in "VINSTANCE" is treated as an addition
       or update to the corresponding generated instance (see
       Section 5).

   2.  Any property (excluding "RECURRENCE-ID" and "INSTANCE-DELETE")
       appearing in "VINSTANCE" is treated as an addition or update to
       the corresponding generated instance (see Section 6).

   3.  Any "INSTANCE-DELETE" property appearing in "VINSTANCE" indicates
       the removal of a component or property from the corresponding
       generated instance (see Section 7)

5.  Adding or Updating Components in an Overridden Instance

   All sub-components in the master component MUST have a "UID" property
   with a value that is unique (at least within that master component).
   This allows such sub-components to be easily identified for the
   purposes of indicating whether a "VINSTANCE" is adding, updating, or
   deleting a sub-component.

   Any iCalendar component defined in the "VINSTANCE" component
   (referred to here as the "instance component"), other than a "PATCH"
   component [draft-patch], is treated as either an addition to the
   generated instance, or as an update of an existing component in the
   generated instance, as follows:

   1.  If the generated instance does not contain a sub-component with a
       "UID" property value matching that of the instance component,
       then the instance component is an addition to the generated
       instance.

   2.  If a sub-component of the generated instance contains a "UID"
       property with a value that matches that of the instance
       component, then the instance component replaces the matching one
       in the generated instance.

   Alternatively, a sub-component can be "incrementally" updated by use
   of a "PATCH" component [draft-patch] that targets the sub-component.
   A "PATCH" component is created by determining the difference between
   the sub-component in the overridden instance and the matching sub-
   component in the generated instance.  The "PATCH-TARGET" property
   value in the "PATCH" component is specified as a path relative to the
   overridden component targeting the sub-component by its "UID"
   property value (e.g., if a "VALARM" component inside a "VEVENT"
   component is being updated, the "PATCH-TARGET" property value would
   be "/VALARM[UID=1234]" (assuming that the "UID" property value of the
   sub-component being updated is "1234").  The "PATCH" component is

Internet-Draft        iCalendar VINSTANCE Component         October 2016


   then added as a sub-component of the "VINSTANCE" component
   representing the overridden instance.

   When expanding a "VINSTANCE" component into an overridden component,
   any "PATCH" sub-components are used to update sub-components in the
   generated instance, by applying the patch processing rules to those
   sub-components.

6.  Adding or Updating Properties in an Overridden Instance

   Any iCalendar property (other than "RECURRENCE-ID" and "INSTANCE-
   DELETE") defined in the "VINSTANCE" component (referred to here as
   the "instance property") is treated as either an addition to the
   generated instance, or as an update of an existing property in the
   generated instance.  A "INSTANCE-ACTION" (Section 9.3) property
   parameter can be defined on instance properties and is used to
   control how they are processed.  The following rules are used to
   process such properties:

   1.  If the instance property does not contain an "INSTANCE-ACTION"
       property parameter, or contains an "INSTANCE-ACTION" property
       parameter with the default value "BYNAME", then all properties
       with the same name in the generated instance are replaced by the
       instance property.

   2.  If the instance property contains an "INSTANCE-ACTION" property
       parameter with the value "CREATE", then the instance property is
       added to the generated instance.

   3.  If the instance property contains an "INSTANCE-ACTION" property
       parameter with the value "UPDATE", then all properties with the
       same name and same value in the generated instance have their
       parameters updated or removed as follows:

       A.  Any parameter name appended to the "UPDATE" parameter value
           with a "~" separator is used to remove matching parameters
           from the derived instance.

       B.  Any parameters, other than "INSTANCE-ACTION", replace any
           parameters with the same name in the derived instance, or are
           added to the derived instance if no there is no parameter
           with the same name.

   4.  If the instance property contains an "INSTANCE-ACTION" property
       parameter with the value starting with "BYPARAM", then all
       properties with the same name and a property parameter that
       matches the one that is part of the "INSTANCE-ACTION" property




Daboo                      Expires May 1, 2017                  [Page 7]

       value, in the generated instance are replaced by the instance
       property.

   The "INSTANCE-ACTION=BYNAME" operation is used for adding or updating
   "singleton" properties - properties that only appear once in a given
   iCalendar component (e.g., "DTSTART", "DTEND", "LOCATION", etc).

   The "INSTANCE-ACTION=CREATE" operation is used for adding "multi-
   occurring" properties - properties that can appear more than once in
   a given iCalendar component (e.g., "ATTENDEE", "ATTACH", "EXDATE",
   etc).

   The "INSTANCE-ACTION=UPDATE" operation is used for updating
   parameters on a specific "multi-occurring" property that can be
   uniquely identified by its value (e.g., the "ATTENDEE" property can
   appear multiple times in a "VEVENT" component, but each property will
   have a unique value in that component).  This operation cannot be
   used when the value of the property is being changed.  Instead, the
   "INSTANCE-ACTION=BYPARAM" operation can be used to identify the
   property being replaced.

   The "INSTANCE-ACTION=BYPARAM" operation is used for updating a
   specific "multi-occurring" property that can be uniquely identified
   by a parameter value that is the same as one in the instance
   property.

   There may be some situations where a multi-occurring property cannot
   be uniquely identified.  In such cases, the solution to updating one
   or more of them is to use an "INSTANCE-ACTION=BYNAME" to replace all
   the existing properties with one new one, then use "INSTANCE-
   ACTION=CREATE" to add back others that are unchanged or also being
   updated.  Whilst this is not ideal, it is anticipated that these
   situations can be avoided by adding appropriate property parameters
   with unique values to help disambiguate the multi-occurring
   properties.

7.  Deleting Components or Properties from an Overridden Instance

   The "INSTANCE-DELETE" property (defined in Section 9.2) is used to
   indicate deletion of iCalendar elements from the generated instance.
   As such, the value of the "INSTANCE-DELETE" property is always a
   relative path (see Section 8) that refers to an element that is an
   immediate "child" of the generated instance.

   The following operations are supported:

   Delete components  the "INSTANCE-DELETE" path value identifies
      components only.  The matching components are removed from the
      generated instance.

   Delete properties  the "INSTANCE-DELETE" path value identifies
      properties only.  The matching properties are removed from the
      generated instance.

8.  iCalendar Path

   This specification makes use of the concept of an "iCalendar path"
   defined in Section XX of [draft-patch].  This specification only
   makes use of "relative" paths to identify components or properties
   directly within a generated instance.

9.  iCalendar Extensions

9.1.  VINSTANCE Component

   Component Name:  VINSTANCE

   Purpose:  Provide components and properties that are used to indicate
      the difference between a generated instance and an actual
      overridden instance.

   Format Definition:  A "VINSTANCE" calendar component is defined by
      the following notation:

   vinstancec    = "BEGIN" ":" "VINSTANCE" CRLF
                     vinstanceprop component
                   "END" ":" "VINSTANCE" CRLF
                   ; Any sub-component allowed except for
                   ; VINSTANCE itself. PATCH sub-components
                   ; are used for incremental updates.

   vinstanceprop = *(
                    ;
                    ; The following is REQUIRED,
                    ; but MUST NOT occur more than once.
                    ;
                    recurid /
                    ;
                    ; The following are OPTIONAL,
                    ; and MAY occur more than once.
                    ;
                    instancedelete / other-prop
                    ;
                  )

   other-prop  = ( iana-prop / x-prop )

   Description:  This component is used to define an overridden instance
      of a master component that can include changes to the generated
      instance, such as component or property additions updates, or
      deletions.  See Section 4 for details.

9.2.  INSTANCE-DELETE Property

   Property Name:  INSTANCE-DELETE

   Purpose:  This property specifies a relative path identifying one or
      more components or properties to be removed from a generated
      instance.

   Value Type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  IANA and nonstandard property parameters can be
      specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified within a "VINSTANCE"
      component only.

   Description:  This property is used to match iCalendar components or
      properties that will be deleted.  The path value is always a
      relative path for only immediate components and properties within
      the generated instance, and interpreted as described in Section 7.

Internet-Draft        iCalendar VINSTANCE Component         October 2016


   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

   idelete       = "INSTANCE-DELETE ideleteparam ":" ideletepath CRLF

   ideleteparam  = *(";" other-param)

   ideletepath   = comp-path / prop-path
                     ; from Section XX of [draft-patch]

   Example:  The following are examples of this property:

   INSTANCE-DELETE:/VALARM[UID=1234]
   INSTANCE-DELETE:#ATTENDEE[=mailto:cyrus@example.com]

9.3.  INSTANCE-ACTION Property Parameter

   Parameter Name:  INSTANCE-ACTION

   Purpose:  To specify whether the property should be added or
      replaced.

   Description:  This property parameter can be specified on properties
      contained in a "VINSTANCE" component and MUST NOT be specified on
      properties outside of a "VINSTANCE" component.  This property
      parameter specifies whether the associated property should be
      added to the generated instance or should replace existing

10.  Conversion to/from VINSTANCE

   Any iCalendar processing engine that supports "VINSTANCE" is allowed
   to convert between the traditional overridden component
   representation and the "VINSTANCE" based representation when
   processing iCalendar data.  However, iCalendar data SHOULD NOT mix
   traditional and "VINSTANCE" based representations in the same
   iCalendar object.  However, when iCalendar data is transferred to
   another system whose support for "VINSTANCE" cannot be confirmed, the
   iCalendar data being transferred MUST be converted into its
   traditional overridden component representation.

Internet-Draft        iCalendar VINSTANCE Component         October 2016


11.  Use with iTIP

   iTIP [RFC5546] defines how iCalendar data can be sent between
   calendar user agents to schedule calendar components between calendar
   users.  This specification does not define how iCalendar objects
   using "VINSTANCE" components can be used with iTIP.

12.  Use with CalDAV and HTTP

   The CalDAV [RFC4791] calendar access protocol allows clients and
   servers to exchange iCalendar data.

   TBD define protocol changes required in clients and servers to allow
   negotiated use of VINSTANCE.

13.  Use with iCalendar VPATCH

   [draft-patch] defines how iCalendar data can updated using a "patch"
   component that defines the changes between the original and updated
   data.  This generic mechanism works with the new "VINSTANCE"
   representation introduced by this specification.

   However, [draft-patch] does define an "implicit" recurrence override
   mechanism, whereby a patch operation can implicitly create an
   overridden component in an iCalendar object by only including
   components and/or properties that are different from the generated
   instance.  An example of an implicit override patch is shown in
   Appendix D.1.  Whilst it is possible to explicitly add a "VINSTANCE"
   component using a patch operation (as shown in Appendix D.2), it
   would be more efficient to allow patch processing engines to create
   "VINSTANCE" components, rather than full overridden components, when
   doing an implicit patch operation.  This specification extends
   [draft-patch] to allow patch processing engines to implement an
   implicit recurrence override patch operation as the addition of
   appropriate "VINSTANCE" components to the master component (an
   example is shown in Appendix D.3).

14.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations described in [RFC5545], and [RFC4791] MUST be
   adhered to.  Since this specification merely defines an alternative
   representation in iCalendar data, it does not introduce any new
   security considerations.

15.  Privacy Considerations

   Privacy considerations described in [RFC5545], and [RFC4791] MUST be
   adhered to.  Since this specification merely defines an alternative
   representation in iCalendar data, it does not introduce any new
   privacy considerations.

16.  IANA Considerations

16.1.  Component Registrations

   This document defines the following new iCalendar components to be
   added to the registry defined in Section 8.3.1 of [RFC5545]:

              +-----------+---------+----------------------+
              | Component | Status  | Reference            |
              +-----------+---------+----------------------+
              | VINSTANCE | Current | RFCXXXX, Section 9.1 |
              +-----------+---------+----------------------+

16.2.  Property Registrations

   This document defines the following new iCalendar properties to be
   added to the registry defined in Section 8.3.2 of [RFC5545]:

           +-----------------+---------+----------------------+
           | Property        | Status  | Reference            |
           +-----------------+---------+----------------------+
           | INSTANCE-DELETE | Current | RFCXXXX, Section 9.2 |
           +-----------------+---------+----------------------+

16.3.  Parameter Registrations

   This document defines the following new iCalendar parameters to be
   added to the registry defined in Section 8.3.3 of [RFC5545]:

           +-----------------+---------+----------------------+
           | Property        | Status  | Reference            |
           +-----------------+---------+----------------------+
           | INSTANCE-ACTION | Current | RFCXXXX, Section 9.3 |
           +-----------------+---------+----------------------+

16.4.  Parameter Value Registry

   A new IANA registry for iCalendar elements has been added.
   Additional codes MAY be used, provided the process described in
   Section 8.2.1 of [RFC5545] is used to register them, using the
   template in Section 8.2.6 of [RFC5545].

16.4.1.  Instance Action Registry

   The following table has been used to initialize the Instance Action
   Registry:

           +-----------------+---------+----------------------+
           | Instance Action | Status  | Reference            |
           +-----------------+---------+----------------------+
           | CREATE          | Current | RFCXXXX, Section 9.3 |
           | UPDATE          | Current | RFCXXXX, Section 9.3 |
           | BYNAME          | Current | RFCXXXX, Section 9.3 |
           | BYPARAM         | Current | RFCXXXX, Section 9.3 |

   This examples shows two overridden instances.  The first one covers
   the case where an attendee has accepted all but one instance of a
   recurring meeting, with the one instance being declined.  The second
   one covers the case where an attendee has responded only to one
   instance of a recurring meeting, with the other instances still
   waiting for a response.
