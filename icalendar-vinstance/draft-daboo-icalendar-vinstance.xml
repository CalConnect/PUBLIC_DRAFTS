    <section title='Introduction'>
      <t>The <xref target='RFC5545'>iCalendar</xref> data format is in widespread use to represent calendar data. iCalendar has a data model that supports the concept of recurring, or repeating, events (or other types of objects such as tasks). With repeating events, it is often the case that one particular instance may differ from the rest. In that case iCalendar requires that all the data for that event be included, even though only a small portion of it may be different. For long lived recurring events with lots of attendees present, this can often result in a significant increase in the size of the iCalendar data as many instances get overridden.</t>
      <t>This specification updates the iCalendar data model to support a new iCalendar component that can be used to represent just the changes in an overridden instance, rather than having to include everything describing it. This can significantly reduce the size of the iCalendar data, leading to reductions in network I/O (with resultant savings in battery usage on mobile devices), and storage requirements, on clients, servers, and associated databases.</t>

    <section title="Overview">
      <t>Recurring events (or other types of component) in iCalendar are defined by the presence of "RRULE", "RDATE", and "EXDATE" properties in a "master component". Those rules produce a set of "generated instances". "Generated instances" do not need to have a representation in the iCalendar data, as their content can be inferred from the "master component". In some cases specific "generated instances" are changed, resulting in an "overridden instance". An "overridden instance" is represented in iCalendar as an "overridden component", which has the same "UID" property value as the "master component", and a "RECURRENCE-ID" property whose value matches the start time of the corresponding "generated instance" (which can be different from the actual start time of the "overridden instance").</t>
      <t>For example, consider the following daily recurring event, with no overridden instances. This event defines a set of generated instances for 20160902, 20160903, 20160904, etc. 
        <figure><artwork>
  BEGIN:VCALENDAR
  PRODID:test
  VERSION:2.0
  BEGIN:VEVENT
  UID:1234
  DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20160902
  DURATION:PT1H
  SUMMARY:Master component
  LOCATION:My office
  RRULE:FREQ=DAILY
  END:VEVENT
  END:VCALENDAR
</artwork></figure>
        If the summary of the second instance needs to be changed, the resulting iCalendar object would be:
        <figure><artwork>
  BEGIN:VCALENDAR
  PRODID:test
  VERSION:2.0
  BEGIN:VEVENT
  UID:1234
  DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20160902
  DURATION:PT1H
  SUMMARY:Master component
  LOCATION:My office
  RRULE:FREQ=DAILY
  END:VEVENT
/ BEGIN:VEVENT
| UID:1234
| RECURRENCE-ID;VALUE=DATE:20160903
| DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20160903
| DURATION:PT1H
| SUMMARY:Override second instance
| LOCATION:My office
\ END:VEVENT
  END:VCALENDAR
</artwork></figure>
        As can be seen, the highlighted overridden component for 20160903 duplicates many iCalendar properties from the master component, with the "SUMMARY" property being different, "RECURRENCE-ID" added, and "DTSTART" adjusted to the start time of the instance. All the other properties are the same as the corresponding ones in the master component. Using the new representation described by this specification, this iCalendar object would appear as:
        <figure><artwork>
  BEGIN:VCALENDAR
  PRODID:test
  VERSION:2.0
  BEGIN:VEVENT
  UID:1234
  DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20160902
  DURATION:PT1H
  SUMMARY:Master component
  LOCATION:My office
  RRULE:FREQ=DAILY
/ BEGIN:VINSTANCE
| RECURRENCE-ID;VALUE=DATE:20160903
| SUMMARY:Override second instance
\ END:VINSTANCE
  END:VEVENT
  END:VCALENDAR
</artwork></figure>
        In this case the highlighted "VINSTANCE" component is used to encapsulate just those iCalendar properties that are different from the generated instance - just "SUMMARY" in this case. The new representation is just over 80% of the size of the traditional representation, giving a small, but not insignificant, reduction in size. But as more overrides are needed, or as more properties are added to the master component, the savings will increase dramatically.

    <section title="VINSTANCE Component" anchor="vinstance-component">
      <t>This specification defines the new "VINSTANCE" component, which is used to represent just the differences between a generated instance, derived from the master component, and the actual overridden instance that will be used instead of the generated instance.</t>
      <t>"VINSTANCE" components MUST only appear as sub-components within master components (e.g., they can only appear as sub-components of components that include at least one of either "RRULE" or "RDATE" properties).</t>
      <t>Each "VINSTANCE" component MUST include a "RECURRENCE-ID" property with a value that identifies the instance being overridden. Multiple "VINSTANCE" components can appear within a single master component, but each MUST have a unique "RECURRENCE-ID" property value. Unlike traditional overridden components, "VINSTANCE" components MUST NOT include a "UID" property (the effective "UID" is that of the master component enclosing the "VINSTANCE" component).</t>
      <t>The iCalendar components and properties within a "VINSTANCE" component are interpreted as follows:
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>Any component appearing in "VINSTANCE" is treated as an addition or update to the corresponding generated instance (see <xref target="instance-components"/>).</t>
          <t>Any property (excluding "RECURRENCE-ID" and "INSTANCE-DELETE") appearing in "VINSTANCE" is treated as an addition or update to the corresponding generated instance (see <xref target="instance-properties"/>).</t>
          <t>Any "INSTANCE-DELETE" property appearing in "VINSTANCE" indicates the removal of a component or property from the corresponding generated instance (see <xref target="instance-delete"/>)</t>
        </list>
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Adding or Updating Components in an Overridden Instance" anchor="instance-components">
      <t>All sub-components in the master component MUST have a "UID" property with a value that is unique (at least within that master component). This allows such sub-components to be easily identified for the purposes of indicating whether a "VINSTANCE" is adding, updating, or deleting a sub-component.</t>
      <t>Any iCalendar component defined in the "VINSTANCE" component (referred to here as the "instance component") is treated as either an addition to the generated instance, or as an update of an existing component in the generated instance, as follows:
      <list style="numbers">
        <t>If the generated instance does not contain a sub-component with a "UID" property value matching that of the instance component, then the instance component is an addition to the generated instance.</t>
        <t>If a sub-component of the generated instance contains a "UID" property with a value that matches that of the instance component, then the instance component replaces the matching one in the generated instance.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Adding or Updating Properties in an Overridden Instance" anchor="instance-properties">
      <t>Any iCalendar property (other than "RECURRENCE-ID" and "INSTANCE-DELETE") defined in the "VINSTANCE" component (referred to here as the "instance property") is treated as either an addition to the generated instance, or as an update of an existing property in the generated instance. A <xref target="instanceaction">"INSTANCE-ACTION"</xref> property parameter can be defined on instance properties and is used to control how they are processed. The following rules are used to process such properties:
      <list style="numbers">
        <t>If the instance property does not contain an "INSTANCE-ACTION" property parameter, or contains an "INSTANCE-ACTION" property parameter with the default value "BYNAME", then all properties with the same name in the generated instance are replaced by the instance property.</t>
        <t>If the instance property contains an "INSTANCE-ACTION" property parameter with the value "CREATE", then the instance property is added to the generated instance.</t>
        <t>If the instance property contains an "INSTANCE-ACTION" property parameter with the value "UPDATE", then all properties with the same name and same value in the generated instance have their parameters updated or removed as follows:
          <list style="letters">
            <t>Any parameter name appended to the "UPDATE" parameter value with a "~" separator is used to remove matching parameters from the derived instance.</t>
            <t>Any parameters, other than "INSTANCE-ACTION", replace any parameters with the same name in the derived instance, or are added to the derived instance if no there is no parameter with the same name.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>If the instance property contains an "INSTANCE-ACTION" property parameter with the value starting with "BYPARAM", then all properties with the same name and a property parameter that matches the one that is part of the "INSTANCE-ACTION" property value, in the generated instance are replaced by the instance property.</t>
      </list>
      </t>
      <t>The "INSTANCE-ACTION=BYNAME" operation is used for adding or updating "singleton" properties - properties that only appear once in a given iCalendar component (e.g., "DTSTART", "DTEND", "LOCATION", etc).</t>
      <t>The "INSTANCE-ACTION=CREATE" operation is used for adding "multi-occurring" properties - properties that can appear more than once in a given iCalendar component (e.g., "ATTENDEE", "ATTACH", "EXDATE", etc).</t>
      <t>The "INSTANCE-ACTION=UPDATE" operation is used for updating parameters on a specific "multi-occurring" property that can be uniquely identified by its value (e.g., the "ATTENDEE" property can appear multiple times in a "VEVENT" component, but each property will have a unique value in that component). This operation cannot be used when the value of the property is being changed. Instead, the "INSTANCE-ACTION=BYPARAM" operation can be used to identify the property being replaced.</t>
      <t>The "INSTANCE-ACTION=BYPARAM" operation is used for updating a specific "multi-occurring" property that can be uniquely identified by a parameter value that is the same as one in the instance property.</t>
      <t>There may be some situations where a multi-occurring property cannot be uniquely identified. In such cases, the solution to updating one or more of them is to use an "INSTANCE-ACTION=BYNAME" to replace all the existing properties with one new one, then use "INSTANCE-ACTION=CREATE" to add back others that are unchanged or also being updated. Whilst this is not ideal, it is anticipated that these situations can be avoided by adding appropriate property parameters with unique values to help disambiguate the multi-occurring properties.</t>

    <section title="Deleting Components or Properties from an Overridden Instance" anchor="instance-delete">
      <t>The "INSTANCE-DELETE" property (defined in <xref target="instancedelete"/>) is used to indicate deletion of iCalendar elements from the generated instance. As such, the value of the "INSTANCE-DELETE" property is always a relative path (see <xref target="path"/>) that refers to an element that is an immediate "child" of the generated instance.</t>
      <t>The following operations are supported:
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Delete components"> the "INSTANCE-DELETE" path value identifies components only. The matching components are removed from the generated instance.</t>

    <section title='Conversion to/from VINSTANCE'>
      <t>Any iCalendar processing engine that supports "VINSTANCE" is allowed to convert between the traditional overridden component representation and the "VINSTANCE" based representation when processing iCalendar data. However, iCalendar data SHOULD NOT mix traditional and "VINSTANCE" based representations in the same iCalendar object. However, when iCalendar data is transferred to another system whose support for "VINSTANCE" cannot be confirmed, the iCalendar data being transferred MUST be converted into its traditional overridden component representation.</t>
    </section>

    <section title='Use with iTIP'>
      <t><xref target="RFC5546">iTIP</xref> defines how iCalendar data can be sent between calendar user agents to schedule calendar components between calendar users. This specification does not define how iCalendar objects using "VINSTANCE" components can be used with iTIP.</t>
    </section>

    <section title='Use with CalDAV and HTTP'>
      <t>The <xref target="RFC4791">CalDAV</xref> calendar access protocol allows clients and servers to exchange iCalendar data.</t>
      <t>TBD define protocol changes required in clients and servers to allow negotiated use of VINSTANCE.</t>
    </section>

    <section title='Use with iCalendar VPATCH'>
      <t>[draft-patch] defines how iCalendar data can updated using a "patch" component that defines the changes between the original and updated data. This generic mechanism works with the new "VINSTANCE" representation introduced by this specification.</t>
      <t>However, [draft-patch] does define an "implicit" recurrence override mechanism, whereby a patch operation can implicitly create an overridden component in an iCalendar object by only including components and/or properties that are different from the generated instance. An example of an implicit override patch is shown in <xref target="example_patch_1"/>. Whilst it is possible to explicitly add a "VINSTANCE" component using a patch operation (as shown in <xref target="example_patch_2"/>), it would be more efficient to allow patch processing engines to create "VINSTANCE" components, rather than full overridden components, when doing an implicit patch operation. This specification extends [draft-patch] to allow patch processing engines to implement an implicit recurrence override patch operation as the addition of appropriate "VINSTANCE" components to the master component (an example is shown in <xref target="example_patch_3"/>).</t>

        <t>This examples shows two overridden instances. The first one covers the case where an attendee has accepted all but one instance of a recurring meeting, with the one instance being declined. The second one covers the case where an attendee has responded only to one instance of a recurring meeting, with the other instances still waiting for a response.
