1.  Introduction

   The objectclass concept is used in ldap to allow the specification of
   a set of properties which describe a given type of object.  For
   example, a schedulable entity SHOULD contain some form of contact and
   the absence of the AUTOSCHEDULE property implies certain defaults.

   Furthermore the OBJECTCLASS property allows for simple searching for
   a particular class of entry.  If we are trying to book a room for
   example, the query only needs to specify an OBJECTCLASS of
   schedulable and the type of entry (that is, a room).

   Without the OBJECTCLASS property it may be hard to determine that a
   room is actually schedulable.  The resence of an email address does
   not guarantee that an entity is schedulable.  Current scheduling
   systems also work asynchronously.  The user may create scheduling
   invitations only to learn later on that the scheduled entity is not
   going to reply.

   An ldap objectclass may be of 3 kinds, structural, abstract and
   auxiliary.  The vcard KIND property is equivalent to the structural
   objectclass in that a vcard can be of only one kind.  The kind
   requires that certain properties be present and also defines defaults
   for absent properties.

   The OBJECTCLASS property defined here is equivalent in many ways to
   the auxiliary objectclass in ldap.  They are not related to each
   other in some hierarchy and may overlap in their use of properties.

   Objectclass definitions can only specify properties which MUST,
   SHOULD or MAY be present.  They cannot disallow the use of properties
   as these may be required by another objectclass.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Objectclass Property

   Format and cardinality of new vCard properties are defined as
   described in Section 3.3 of [RFC6350].

   Property name:  OBJECTCLASS

   Purpose:  To specify the objectclass for this vcard.

   ValueType:  IANA value.

   Cardinality:  *

   ABNF:  OBJECTCLASS-param = any-param
      OBJECTCLASS-value = text

   Default value:  None.

   Example value:  schedulable

   Description:  This property MAY be present 1 or more times.  For each
      occurrence of the property the vcard MUST conform to the
      specification for that objectclass.

4.  Examples

   These examples do not draw on any currently defined objectclass but
   are intended to indicate some uses.  Properties used here may not be
   defined in any specification.

4.1.  Eduperson vcard

   The eduperson ldap objectclass provides for a number of attributes
   considered useful for interaction between members of educational
   organizations.  A corresponding vcard objectclass would allow for
   better mappping of ldap directories onto a vcard representation.

   The 201203 specification of the LDAP objectclass for reference.  Note
   that all attributes are MAY so would have a vcard cardinality of *1
   or *.

   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.5923.1.1.2
           NAME 'eduPerson'
           AUXILIARY
           MAY ( eduPersonAffiliation $
                       eduPersonNickname $
                       eduPersonOrgDN $
                       eduPersonOrgUnitDN $
                       eduPersonPrimaryAffiliation $
                       eduPersonPrincipalName $
                       eduPersonEntitlement $
                       eduPersonPrimaryOrgUnitDN $
                       eduPersonScopedAffiliation $
                       eduPersonTargetedID $
                       eduPersonAssurance)

   A vcard mapping would, where possible use existing vcard properties.
   Where not possible new properties could be defined.

4.2.  Schedulable

   A schedulable entity can be scheduled for meetings (as a person) or
   for use (as a resource).  For a scheduling system to be able to
   usefully manage the schedule it needs specific information.

   At the very least there needs to be some form of calendar user
   address.  It's useful to know whether requests can be auto accepted
   if the slot is available.

   Building on the previous example we'll make Jack schedulable.

5.  Security Considerations

   As this document only defines a schema related property and does not
   refer to the actual storage mechanism itself, no special security
   considerations are required as part of this document.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  New VCard Objectclass Value Registration

   New objectclass values will be defined according to the process
   specified in Section 10.2.6 of [RFC6350].

7.  Acknowledgments

   This specification is a result of discussions that took place within
   the Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium's Resource Technical
   Committee.  The authors thank the participants of that group.
