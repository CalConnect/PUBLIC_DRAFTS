= Reference Types

The actual reference value can take three forms specified by the type
parameter

URI: ::  The default type.  This is a URI referring to the target.

UID: ::  This allows for linking within a single collection and the
   value is assumed to be another component within that collection.

REFERENCE: ::  An xpointer.  In an XML environment it may be necessary
   to refer to an external XML artifact.  The XPointer is defined in
   <<W3C.WD-xptr-xpointer-20021219>> and allows addressing portions of
   XML documents.
